BUSINESS\nOverview\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and\nproduct expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our\nplatform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing\nservices, and connect Riders and other consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers\n(\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility\nDrivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network,\ntechnology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers (\u201cShipper(s)\u201d) with carriers (\u201cCarrier(s)\u201d) in the freight industry by providing Carriers\nwith the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions\nto everyday problems.\nOur technology is available in approximately 70 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the\nMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nOur Segments\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings\neach address large, fragmented markets.\nMobility\nOur Mobility offering connects consumers with a wide range of transportation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, micromobility, rentals, public\ntransit, taxis, and more\u2014helping customers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global leadership position\u2014and the vast amount of marketplace data\nthat comes along with it\u2014means that we have the best technical and data platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products.\nWe believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a variety of vehicle types, providing\nconsumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and\nadvertising. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.\nDelivery\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover the best of local commerce\u2014from restaurants to grocery, alcohol, convenience and other\nretailers\u2014order a meal or other items, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We launched our Delivery app, Uber Eats, over seven years ago, and\nthe business now includes the applications Postmates, Drizly and Cornershop across different markets. We believe our Delivery offering increases consumer\nengagement with the Uber platform overall, which in turn results in broader reach for our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without\nincreasing their own costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages, and has expanded our earner base by increasing utilization and earnings across\nthe network. We also believe it also attracts new Drivers to the platform who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles. Over the last several years our\nDelivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a-Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as\nadvertising opportunities.\nFreight\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network and connects Shippers and\nCarriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries.\nFreight provides an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end while providing visibility and control of logistics networks.\nFreight connects Carriers with Shippers\u2019 shipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment\nwith the touch of a button. Freight serves Shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises. By leveraging logistics solutions\nexpertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand with real-time pricing, and track those\nshipments from pickup to delivery. Freight operations are principally based in North America and Europe. We believe that all of these factors represent significant\nefficiency improvements over traditional transportation management and freight brokerage providers.\n4Platform Synergies\nOur Platform\nThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. Together, these elements power\nmovement from point A to point B.\nMassive Network Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers and\nCarriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In\napproximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of December 31, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a\nbutton for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.\nLeading TechnologyWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep\ntechnology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies\nmake it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.\nOperational ExcellenceOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale\nproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.\nProduct ExpertiseOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide\nplatform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.\nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.\nWe believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing\nplatform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform-to-platform users. For example,\nDelivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2022, over 61% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our\nplatform. Additionally, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 10.9 Trips per month on\naverage, compared to 4.6 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We\nbelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. In 2020, we rolled out our \u201cSuper App\u201d view on iOS and Android,\nwhich combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in\nthe United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special\npricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to\nremain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding\nexperience for our consumers. We exited 2022 with nearly 12 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs.\nWe are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking\ncross-platform advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber\u2019s advertising division and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way\nfor brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process. We now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising\noptions on the Uber and Uber Eats apps, and beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provide comprehensive\nreporting and analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with consumers at\nrelevant points throughout their journeys and transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2022, active advertising merchants exceeded 315,000. We believe that our\nadvertising further strengthens the power of our platform and will continue to do so as we onboard more advertisers.\nCompetitive Environment\nWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the\nlogistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from\nnew market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as\nexisting products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings\nacross a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop\nspecialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\n5\u2022Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets\nthat we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,\npublic transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We\nalso compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and Riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Bolt,\nand our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\n\u2022Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers,\nconsumers, and merchants, including Amazon, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero, DoorDash, Gopuff, iFood, Instacart, Just Eat Takeaway, and Rappi. Our\nDelivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\n\u2022Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,\nConvoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,\nand regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection,\npayments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are\nconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we\nare subject to are described below.\nMobility\nOur platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous\njurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within\nthe United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,\nincluding licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,\nand regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions,\nincluding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and\nregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates\nsignificant complexities for our business and operating model.\nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network\nCompany (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own\nvehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,\nbackground checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California\u2019s Assembly\nBill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney\nGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified,\nand sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court\nissued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were\ngranted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that\nprovides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and as a result of the passage\nof Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with\nthe provisions of Proposition 22. See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A and \u201cNote 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business. For example:\n\u2022In London, Transport for London (\u201cTfL\u201d) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November\n2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not \u201cfit and proper,\u201d including with respect to confidence in our change and release\nmanagement processes. We successfully appealed and since September 2020,\n6we have been operating under a license in London. Our current TfL license, a 30 month operating license, was granted to us in May 2022.\n\u2022Since April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational\nrequirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data\nsharing requirement and a requirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing\nservices. Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,\ncould have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate\nin Mexico City.\n\u2022In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap\non the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard for time\nand distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on\nour platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our\nplatform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement\nminimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory\ninitiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.\nSee the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant\ncomplexities for our business and operating model.\nAs we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.\nData Privacy and Protection\nOur technology platform, and the user data we collect and process to run our business, are an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our\ncompliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust.\nRegulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of\npersonal data, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications\nfor our business are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more\nstringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into\neffect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses. U.S. state, city, federal, and\nforeign regulators are expected to continue proposing and adopting significant laws impacting the processing of personally identifiable information and other data\nrelating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending\nin India.\nPayments and Financial Services\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber\nPayments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d).\nRegulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to\ncontinue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect\nour ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other\njurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.\nAntitrust\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit\nfuture acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other\nrestrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing\nmodels.\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. Our intellectual\nproperty includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names,\n7software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions\n(whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,\nand disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as\nappropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,\nand distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon our\nability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies. We continue to develop new technologies to enhance existing offerings\nand services, and to expand the range of our offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nSeasonality\nMobility\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operating results as we generate higher Gross Bookings in our fourth quarter compared to other\nquarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower Gross Bookings in our third quarter compared to other quarters\ndue in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North America and Europe. We have typically experienced quarter-over-quarter declines in\nMobility in the first quarter. In 2022, we experienced altered seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. These primarily relate to\nCOVID-19 variant outbreaks that drove lower Mobility volume and higher Delivery volume. We expect that seasonality will return to its historic patterns as\nrecovery from the pandemic continues.\nDelivery\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operating results with increases in our Gross Bookings in the first and fourth quarters compared to\nthe second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2022, we experienced altered seasonality as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. These primarily relate to COVID-19 variant outbreaks that drove lower Mobility volume and higher\nDelivery volume. We expect that seasonality will return to its historic patterns as recovery from the pandemic continues.\nHuman Capital at Uber\nEmployees\nWe are a global company and as of December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 32,800 employees globally and operations in\napproximately 70 countries and approximately 10,500 cities around the world. Our human capital strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People\nOfficer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high\ndemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.\nOur Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and the Compensation Committee has incorporated employee retention metrics into\nthe compensation packages of our most senior executives.\nAdapting to a New Way of Working. In 2022, more than two years after we asked employees who were able to do so work remotely in light of the COVID-19\npandemic, we reopened our offices and welcomed our employees back to the office. The world of work has changed significantly in the last two years, and in\nresponse we have evolved our work philosophy to reflect all that we have learned and what we believe will produce the best results for our employees and our\nbusiness going forward. Our work model has shifted to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home.\nEmployee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and\nare able to achieve their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys\nand related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021,\nwe made a shift toward continuous listening by collecting feedback from employees throughout the year and through various channels. We use the results of these\nregular checks to better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and\ngrowth opportunities. For example, our hybrid return-to-office approach was shaped based on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we\nalso monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operations\n8through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.\nEmployee Development and Retention. We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, satisfied, and productive.\nEmployees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, participating in mentorship, or identifying their\nnext opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term\nstretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs\nand resources that promote wellness and productivity. This helps our diverse employee base manage life\u2019s expected and unexpected events. Globally, Uber offers\ncompetitive benefits packages to our employees and their families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.\nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future\nattrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our\n2022 People and Culture Report, which is available on our website. The information in the 2022 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that great minds don\u2019t think alike, and we work hard to ensure that people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome and valued. We encourage\ndifferent opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work\nenvironment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement\nprocesses throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,\nLGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadership\nroles come from historically underrepresented groups.\nOur Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensation\npackages of our most senior executives.\nWe encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber\u2019s People Team or the\nIntegrity Helpline.\nAs a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially. To do\nthat, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.\nIn July 2020, we announced commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have made progress on our commitment to build racial\nequity internally and externally. For example, with the goal of ridding racism from our platform, we rolled out anti-racism and unconscious bias training for riders\nand drivers in the United States and Brazil.\nFor more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2022 People and Culture Report and our 2022 ESG Report, which are\navailable on our website. The information in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K.\nDriver and Courier Well-Being\nIn addition to employees discussed above, our business also depends on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and\nCouriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations.\nIn relation to those individuals who earn income on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, providing accessible, flexible\nwork in approximately 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our\nplatform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an\nimprovement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber\nmonitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide\ngeographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an\napp to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally\npatchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is\neither an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At\nUber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative\nways to address these issues.\n\u2022Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work\nshould be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the\n9social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and other app based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising\nthe flexibility of their use of the app. Some recent examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and\nprotections are as follows:\n\u25e6In Washington State, we welcomed a new law that preserves rideshare driver independence and confers new benefits such as minimum earnings\nguarantee, injury protection and paid sick leave.\n\u25e6 In Chile, the legislature passed a law that incorporates platform workers into the government\u2019s healthcare and pensions scheme and introduces\nnew requirements for platform companies such as minimum earnings guarantee for time spent actively working, maintain on-app insurance\ncoverage, and provide couriers with safety equipment.\n\u2022Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers.\n\u2022Earnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make\ninformed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\n\u2022Learning and Growth: We have partnered with learning and academic institutions to provide opportunities to eligible Drivers and their family members\nthrough undergraduate degree programs and courses on entrepreneurship, skills development and language learning. For example, since its launch in 2018,\nour partnership with Arizona State University has enrolled nearly 5,000 Drivers and their family members in undergraduate degree programs online.\n\u2022Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe that\nthe best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers\nto participate in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the world, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveys\nto gather feedback on our app, our support services, and other matters.\nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and\ncarriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely\nimpacted.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well our 2022 ESG Report and our 2022 People and Culture Report.

RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following\nrisks, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and the related\nnotes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\noperating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not\nbelieve are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\n10The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\u2022Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\u2022The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,\nlow barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\u2022To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,\nand may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\nsignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u2022If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or other\nfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\n\u2022Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning\ncould adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative\npublicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and\nenhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n\u2022Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these\nchallenges may not be successful.\n\u2022If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be\nadversely affected.\n\u2022Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may\nharm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.\n\u2022We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are\ninherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\n\u2022We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by\neconomic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions, public health concerns or other circumstances.\n\u2022We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such\ntechnologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by\ncompetitors or non-autonomous vehicles.\n\u2022We have experienced and may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction\nof our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.\n\u2022Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation,\nbusiness, and operating results.\n\u2022We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely\nimpacted.\n\u2022We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise,\nincluding those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\n\u2022Outbreaks of contagious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of actions to mitigate such pandemic, have adversely affected, and\nfuture outbreaks of disease may adversely affect, parts of our business.\n\u2022We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and\nofferings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely\naffected.\n\u2022We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\n11\u2022If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any\nbusinesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\n\u2022We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to\nmodify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\n\u2022Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\n\u2022Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\n\u2022We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which have resulted and may result in investigations,\ninquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\n\u2022If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of\nothers, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating\nperformance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and\nmay lose all or part of your investment.\nOperational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business\nOperational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)\narbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual\nsettlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $521 million as of December 31, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal\nproceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively\nimpact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\nDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have\nbrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like\nours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be\nfiled.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions within the United States and abroad. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a\ncomplaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that\nmay be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a\nresult of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating\nDrivers,\n12including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee\nbenefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset\nthese additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly\naffected. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,\nand we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change\nour business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOther examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a\n\u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an\nemployee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that\nDrivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes\nemployment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining\nagreement.\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers\nbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of\nDrivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt\nour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation\nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates\u201d included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low\nbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these\nindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are\nhighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and\nCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers\nto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to\nshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other\nmerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of\norders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a\nlimited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than\nwe do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In\naddition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers value\nmore highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competition could result in,\namong other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and\nour margins.\nWe face competition in each of our offerings, including:\n\u2022 Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the\nmarkets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In\naddition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in\nmany cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including\nLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\n\u2022 Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in\n13various regions for Drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just\nEat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal\nkit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\n\u2022 Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers such as C.H. Robinson,\nTotal Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nMany of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative products and\nofferings, and alternative pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those that we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitors\nhave, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier bases in a particular geographic\nmarket. In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating\nhistories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respond more\nquickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which may render\nour products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation\nvictories we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.\nAs a result of certain divestitures, we are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our\nbusiness, including in China through August 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia through the later of March 2023 or one year after we dispose\nof all interests in Grab, and the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-scooters through May\n2023, while none of our minority-owned affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. Didi currently competes with us in certain\ncountries in Latin America and in Australia. In addition, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture currently competes with us in certain countries in Europe and Africa. As\nDidi and our other minority-owned affiliates continue to expand their businesses, they may in the future compete with us in additional geographic markets. In\naddition, we are contractually restricted from competing with some of our majority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including\ncompeting against Uber Freight with respect to freight brokerage.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our acquisitions, we may not ultimately consummate such acquisitions or may consummate\nthem only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is obtained. Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all or\npart of our or the target company\u2019s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to compete effectively would\nhave an adverse effect on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nTo remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and\nmay continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions, which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect\nour financial performance.\nTo remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service\nfees, and we have offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets,\nwe have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives a\nDriver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets and\nregions, we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discounts\nand promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts and\npromotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and will\ncontinue to negatively affect, our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been\nmodified over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing\nmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see in\nthe application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these and\nsimilar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely impacted.\nThe markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors\nwill continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders have made substantial investments in certain of our competitors and may increase such\ninvestments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic\ntransactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to lower\ntheir prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and\n14Carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or maintain or increase our Driver\nincentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee\nthat they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\nsignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion in the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2021 and 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $32.8 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels\nand decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we\nmay not be able to maintain or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses,\nas we continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts,\nand promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire\nadditional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in\nincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase\nrevenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to\nadd value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower\nservice fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a\nnegative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to\nadditional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or\nmaintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to\nachieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in the United\nStates, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the\nnear term.\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a sufficient number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or\nother factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.\nOur success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to develop our network scale and liquidity in that geographic market by\nattracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, we may lack a\nsufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply\nconstraints in most geographic markets in which we operate. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase\nor may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the supply liquidity that we experience in that market. Similarly, if\nCarriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of Carriers in specific\ngeographic markets to attract Shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in a specific geographic market, or\nif merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, we may lack a sufficient variety and\nsupply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offering will become less appealing to\nconsumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurant groups and other merchants, and\nthis concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant\nrestaurant partners. If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a\nfare, Carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform. An insufficient supply of platform users\nwould decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we may benefit from having larger scale and liquidity than\nsome competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcome by smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance between\nsupply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may be more important to service quality than the absolute size of\nthe network. If our service quality diminishes or our competitors\u2019 products achieve greater market adoption, our competitors may be able to grow at a quicker rate\nthan we do and may diminish our network effect.\nOur number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operation\nof our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and\nmerchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand,\nincluding as a result of safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of\ndisease or similar public health concern, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundamentally changed,\n15dissatisfaction with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In addition, if we are unable to\nprovide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to attract\nand retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish or maintain active accounts with us,\nif a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we cannot otherwise\nattract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.\nThe number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide their\nservices through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or\nservices, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other\naspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar\nwork, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to\nimprove our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\nOften, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely be\nviewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security\nbreaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and\nmerchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our\nautonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted\nin protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may\nresult, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our\nnetwork liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage. Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or\nCarriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our future operating results.\nIn addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to\nour platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,\nprosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make\ndeliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to\nprovide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially\ndifferent type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an\nefficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any\nchanges to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required\nto recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in\ncertain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The\nfailure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing\nperiodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative publicity\nregarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our\nbrand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the\nengagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse\nplatform user sentiment.\nWe receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and fuels distrust of our company.\nNegative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it difficult for us to attract and\nretain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional\nlitigation and governmental investigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their\ncategory positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\nWe recently released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed\nto have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, as well as\npublic responses to any third party\n16assessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect\nour reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As\nour platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage\nto our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies,\nincluding Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and\nany damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain\ndivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China and to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and while we have certain contractual protections in\nplace governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be\naware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we announced that we are actively\nlooking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or Carriers provide\ndiminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive\nunfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our\nbrand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a\ngood reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs,\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and\nmedia strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their\nofferings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our\nbrand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and\nreputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these\nchallenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in\nthe future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally.\nAlthough we have since made changes in our company\u2019s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote\ntransparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating\nresults, and prospects.\nOur historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing,\ncausing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts\nmay not be successful.\nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several reductions in workforce. If we are\nunable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any future reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future\nprospects will be adversely affected.\nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and\nhas placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and\ninternal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect\nour operating results.\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 32,800 global employees as of\nDecember 31, 2022, of whom approximately 19,200 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside the\nUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,\nincluding engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new\nhires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our\nexisting employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in\nworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions\nin workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in\nworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult\nfor us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly\nmanaging our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could\nlikewise harm our business.\n17Our failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow\nresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve\nthe technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls\nover financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our\ntransaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with\nrespect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving\nrisks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current\nand planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire\nadditional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or\nCarriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors\u2019 platforms, which would adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers, Shippers, employees,\nproducts and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as\nwell as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and\nmature in these areas. If we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address\ncompetitive challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.\nIf platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attract\nand retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or otherwise, and we may be unable\nto protect or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers, and third parties. Such\nactions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reputational damage, or\nsignificant liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers through\nthird-party service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certain\njurisdictions according to national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose\ninformation that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility. Further, the qualification and background check standards for Couriers are generally less\nextensive than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not independently test Drivers\u2019 driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue to\nreceive complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civil\nlitigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety of\nour platform.\nIf Drivers or Carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or Carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform\nas a conduit for criminal activity, consumers and Shippers may not consider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result\nof our business relationship with such Driver or Carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents\nand allegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or\notherwise engaging in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or\nmisconduct while using our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain regions where we operate have\nhigh rates of violent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing\nreports of Drivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our\nplatform. If other criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users\nmay be harmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,\nwhether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers,\nor third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face\nlitigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the\ngrowth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and\nface a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven\nroadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles\n18predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail,\nespecially during \u201crush\u201d hours, all of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover\nall potential claims to which we are exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative\npublicity, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in\nliability, we will incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk\nwill grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently\nrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new\ntechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several\ncountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,\nwhich operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary\nUber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight\u2019s business through Transplace\u2019s expertise in transportation management. We also plan to invest\nsignificant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our\ndevelopment budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy.\nOur new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have\nlimited or no prior development or operating experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities (including,\nbut not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not currently anticipate.\nThere can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiatives\nwill gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is\nalso possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts\nwith respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our\nmore established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory authorities may\nsubject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercializing new\nproducts, offerings or technologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects\nmay be harmed.\nOur business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we are\nunable to manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we operated in approximately 70 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 76% of all Trips. We\nhave limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to\nexpand our international operations and compete with local and other global competitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not be\nsuccessful and may negatively affect our operating results.\nConducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the same\ndegree in the United States. These risks include, among others:\n\u2022 operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u2022 the resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptation\nof our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;\n\u2022 laws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, payment methods, Internet\nactivities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network companies (such as ridesharing), logistics services,\npayment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and\nbackground checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,\nownership of intellectual property, and other activities important to our business;\n\u2022 competition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existing\nrelationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;\n\u2022 differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;\n19\u2022 differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform;\n\u2022 exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;\n\u2022 legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a\nlack of clear legal precedent;\n\u2022 difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor\nunions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;\n\u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;\n\u2022 regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in the\nsame currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n\u2022 adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of\nearnings;\n\u2022 increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;\n\u2022 difficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across multiple offerings and\njurisdictions;\n\u2022 import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;\n\u2022 political, social, and economic instability abroad, war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attacks and security concerns in\ngeneral, and societal crime conditions that harm or disrupt the global economy and/or can directly impact platform users;\n\u2022 public health concerns or emergencies, including pandemics and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to\ntime occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate; and\n\u2022 reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.\nThese risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.\nOur growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with\nand investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy\nhas also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our\ncompetitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, and Aurora.\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of\nDidi, and therefore we do not participate in its day-to-day management or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi. We are not represented on the\nmanagement teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime and\nAurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these companies may make decisions\nor take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally, these companies have expanded their\nofferings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets throughout the world. While this could\nenhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would be adversely affected by\nsuch expansion into markets in which we operate.\nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of these\nassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect\nsuch valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could\nadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies\nhave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited\npublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are\n20domiciled and operate in countries with particular economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on their business; are domiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions;\ndepend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of\nthese individuals could have an adverse effect on the relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations\nand expansion and to maintain their competitive positions. For example, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, members of our management team\nresigned from the board of our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, and we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining\nholdings in the joint venture. The broader consequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and\ngeopolitical shifts, increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on the global economy,\ncannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\noperating results, or the trading price of our common stock.\nFurther, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora\u2019s November 2021 initial public\noffering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would\nnot be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company under the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the\nrequirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets. Accordingly, we may\nnever realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely\naffected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher\nrevenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our\nthird quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically\nexperienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first\nand fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2022, we\nexperienced altered seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. These primarily relate to COVID-19 variant outbreaks that drove\nlower Mobility volume and higher Delivery volume. We expect that seasonality will return to its historic patterns as recovery from the pandemic continues. Our\ngrowth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as\nour growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our\noperating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users,\nincreased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate\ngrowth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental\nor other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we\nmay not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and\ninvestments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our\nexpectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their\ninvestment.\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results\nand future prospects.\nWe believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022 grow supply and demand on our platform;\n\u2022 increase existing platform users\u2019 activity on our platform;\n\u2022 continue to introduce our platform to new markets;\n\u2022 provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers;\n\u2022 expand our business and increase our market share and category position;\n\u2022 compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\n\u2022 develop new products, offerings, and technologies;\n\u2022 identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or\n21expand our platform;\n\u2022 penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\n\u2022 reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public\ntransportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\n\u2022 maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\n\u2022 enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,\nJapan, South Korea, and Spain; and\n\u2022 increase positive perception of our brand.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming\nfrom stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier demand,\nwhether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, pandemics, licensing fees in\nvarious jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not\nachieve profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large\nmetropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted.\nIn 2022, we derived 22% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City in the United States, Sao\nPaulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver\nincentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results\nare susceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious\ndiseases or other viruses could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which we operate. Any\nshort-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics could\nhave an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these\nkey metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such\nevents in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase our\noperating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing licenses or do not receive new\nlicenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity\nconcerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid,\nthe cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural\nareas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would\nbe limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\nIn 2022, we generated 15% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports. Sustained declines in air travel have in the past, and may in the future, suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross\nBookings from airport trips. For example, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing the demand\nfor Mobility to and from airports. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service\nproviders obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether. Despite\nsuch bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may result in\nthe imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport\noperations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-\nups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers\ncould decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into agreements with most major U.S.\nairports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to\nrenew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\n22If we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such\ntechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-\nautonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our\nplatform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment\nin the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-\ndriving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which\nwe compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla,\nApple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car\nmanufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has already\nintroduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier\nthan we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners. In the event that our\ncompetitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be\nsuperior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete\nmore effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially\nreduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as\ncompared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our\nfinancial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nAutonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicle\ntechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability\nfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,\nand operating results.\nFederal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. These\nregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,\nwe may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner to\noffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners could\nbecome subject to substantial fines or penalties.\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high\ndemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture and\nworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.\nOur employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we have implemented our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan, which\nincludes a shift to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining\nour corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, increasing attrition or limiting our\nability to attract employees if individuals prefer to work full time at home or in the office. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or\nadditional negative publicity could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of senior\nmanagement or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives and\nemployees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.\nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We have\nentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration.\nIn addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition\ninto new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating\nresults. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel\ntransitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person\u2019s skills, knowledge of our business, and\nyears of\n23industry experience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future business prospects\ncould be adversely affected.\nTo attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to attract and retain the personnel\nwe require to operate our business effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract, retain, and motivate employees may not be as effective as in\nthe past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase commensurate with expectations or consistent with our historical stock price growth. If\nwe are unable to attract and retain high-quality management and operating personnel, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely\naffected. In addition, we rely heavily on equity as a component of compensation, which may not always align with the Company's business and financial interests.\nWe have experienced, and may experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or\ndestruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, which could cause loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business\ndisruption, and significant liabilities.\nWe collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 license\nnumbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information. As such, we are an\nattractive target of data security attacks by third parties. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure,\nalteration or destruction of, any such data could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation and\nbrand, a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise\nprocess some of our data and that of platform users, and any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use,\nacquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such information could have similar adverse consequences for us.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often unrecognizable\nuntil launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures. Our servers and platform may be\nvulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measures\nmay misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or personal information held by or on behalf of us, disrupt our operations, damage our computers, or otherwise\ndamage our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches,\nincluding potential liability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.\nSecurity breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmental\ninvestigation. We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in September 2022, we experienced a\ncybersecurity incident where an attacker accessed several internal systems. As an earlier example, in May 2014, we experienced a data security incident in which\nan outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an employee had unintentionally\nposted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the \u201c2014 Breach\u201d). In October and November of 2016, outside actors downloaded the\npersonal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the \u201c2016 Breach\u201d). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile\nphone numbers, and drivers\u2019 license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this incident, see the risk\nfactors titled \u201c\u2014We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d)\noffices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business\u201d and \u201c\u2014We face risks related to our collection,\nuse, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative\npress about our privacy and data protection practices,\u201d below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the\ncompanies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security\nincident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a\nresult of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to\nour brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that\nallowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a\nresulting class action litigation. Moreover, in January 2023, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) announced a final order relating to the data security\nincident. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate\nthis or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Security and\nprivacy incidents have led to, and may continue to lead to, additional regulatory scrutiny.\n24Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing and social engineering attacks could harm our\nreputation, business, and operating results.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and\nmobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information\ntechnology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data,\nincluding sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware,\nviruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may\noccur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be\nsufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network,\napplications, identity management solutions or data security have in the past and could in the future disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our\nability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our\nintellectual property or other assets, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or legal liability, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise\nadversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing\nrisks.\nVarious other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,\nissues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or\nbreaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees, contractors, or platform users to disclose\ninformation to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these\nissues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of\nplatform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed,\nand continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on\nour platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result\nof, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that\nevolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance,\nreliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely\nharm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract\nand retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, we may\nfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nTo continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development\nof new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For\nexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about\nrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further\nstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features\ndepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new\nor upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in\nCalifornia have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and\nadverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do\nnot perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which would adversely affect our\noperating results.\nWe track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with\ninformation provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational metrics are subject to\ninherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with internal systems and tools,\nand our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, that are not independently verified by any third\nparty and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by\n25third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and\nour methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly\ndisclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain\nalgorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our\nmetrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our products are used across large populations globally. For\nexample, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect\nand prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics or our estimates of our category position or\nour equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates\nof our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our\nreputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, and\nsafety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other\nadverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow\nconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).\nIn 2022, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 6% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in\nwhich Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many\njurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply\nwith these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those\njurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for\nDrivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety\nincidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of\nthese concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may\ncontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash\nreceived for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always\neffective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot\nguarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a\nvariety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail,\nwe may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection\nfailure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our\nfinancial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn 2022, 72% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly\nlimit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry\n(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed\nby the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and other\nnetwork operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card\nnetwork rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may\nreveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self- assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any\ndeficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,\neven if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new\noperating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to\nviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive\nincentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons,\nor the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and\noperating results.\n26Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.\nOur platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent\nupon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the\nfuture contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our\nsoftware, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions\nbetween systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the\navailability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that\ncould result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such\nas outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users\nmay experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release\nof new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs,\nor vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss\nof platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial\nresults. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or\nautomated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or\nothers could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions,\npredictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or\nreputational harm.\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely\nimpacted.\nWe face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d) and lower carbon\nbusiness models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration\nof extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party\nsuppliers, and the business of merchants, Shippers, Carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to\nmaintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of\nvehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers\nmay be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted\nin London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we\nexperience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise,\nincluding those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\nWe have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net\nzero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets\nenvironmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards\nour climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our\ncontrol, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to\ndedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is\ndependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the\navailability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to\nmeet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have\nan adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\nGeneral Economic Risks\nOutbreaks of contagious disease and the impact of actions to mitigate the such disease or pandemic, have adversely impacted and could in the future adversely\nimpact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n27Occurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition and results of operation. We also face risks related to health epidemics, outbreaks of contagious disease, and other adverse health developments. For\nexample, the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to had an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our\nMobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand, as well as impacting Driver supply constraints. As another example, during the COVID-19\npandemic, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally.\nThe extent of the impact of any future pandemic or outbreak of disease, on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments,\nincluding the duration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the\nUnited States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact\non global supply chains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent\nchanges to our end-users\u2019 behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact any future pandemic or outbreak of a disease, or a catastrophic event will have on our business partners and third-\nparty vendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. For example, concerns over\nthe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which adversely impacted our stock price and our ability to access\ncapital markets, and any future pandemics or other catastrophic events may have a similar impact. To the extent a pandemic or other catastrophic event adversely\naffects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the\nforegoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on\ndiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage\nmarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding slower growth or recession, inflation and higher interest rates, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results of operations. For\nexample, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary\nperiods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point\nproducts over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or\nmay reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business,\nfinancial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend\nto be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally\nconsidered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in\nour network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could\nharm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or alternative opportunities for\nwork, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used\nvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and may\ncontinue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and Carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs,\nincreased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certain\ninternational markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and Carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these\nincreased costs may cause Drivers and Carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these\nincreased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants\nto cease operations altogether, or may cause Carriers to pass costs on to Shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased supply of\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could harm our business and operating results.\nDependencies on Third Parties\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our\ncontrol.\n28Our business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet\ninfrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and\nofferings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt\nto access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and\nmay use our competitors\u2019 products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications\noperators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to\nsignificantly decrease.\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a\npower outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and\nplatform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services,\nand local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and\nsubject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new\nproducts to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile\ncommunications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings.\nIf such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for\ndownload. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces\nwill not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users\u2019 permission to track their activities across\nthird-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of\nsuch advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our\nplatform. We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to\nthe functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our\nplatform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is\npossible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not\nprovide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may\nbe required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely\naffect our business.\nOur business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our\nplatform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platform\nacross these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may\nnot be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether\ndue to actions of third parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party elements become unavailable or\nunavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We rely on third parties for\nelements of our payment-processing infrastructure to remit payments to Drivers, merchants, and Carriers using our platform, and these third parties may refuse to\nrenew our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on\nacceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and\nother processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased\nfees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us.\nIf these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and have\ncaused substantial Driver dissatisfaction and generated a significant number of Driver complaints. Future failures of the payment processing infrastructure\nunderlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations\n29and could cause them to instead use our competitors\u2019 platforms. If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure declines as a result of these\nlimitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to Drivers, merchants, and Carriers could be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to\nother third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective,\nefficient, or well-received by platform users.\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in services\nfrom these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.\nWe use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physical\noperation of any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our third-party service providers. These third-party operations and co-located data\ncenters may experience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. These facilities may also be\nvulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events. Our\nsystems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party service\nproviders to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or require\nus to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss of\ndata, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch\nto another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center\nproviders are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located data center facilities\nhave no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on\ncommercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is\narranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and Carriers to stop offering their services\nthrough our platform, and reduce use of our platform by consumers and Shippers. Our business and operating results may be harmed if current and potential\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers believe our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computational\ncapacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised,\nwhich would have an adverse effect on our growth and business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.\nWe use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source\nsoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing\nterms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\nmake available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designed to monitor\nour compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source\nlicense review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of\nsuch license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source\nsoftware license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such\nlicenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions\nof our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-\nsource licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present\nadditional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our\nplatform. Additionally, because any software source code that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projects\nbecomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be\nunable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial\ncondition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.\nFinancing and Transactional Risks\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nTo continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest\n30in new products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders\nmay suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders.\nCertain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur\nadditional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business\nopportunities. For example, our existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able\nto obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our\nability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may\nlimit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $152 million of\nCareem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of December 31, 2022. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing\nand future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur\nadditional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce\nthe funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working\ncapital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our\nvulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and\nthe industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow\nfrom operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to\nfund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash\nfrom operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.\nIn addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations,\nincluding limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the\npayment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising\nactivities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities,\nincluding potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our\nability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\nIn addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled \u201cManagement's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\u201d\nWe may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nThe tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. For example, we\nmay become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many other\nmultinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate.\nCurrently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our compliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe\nadditional taxes.\nCertain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed\nto contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters\nare being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject\nto such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play\npayment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.\nAdditionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for\nvaluing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future\nincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well\n31as foreign tax authorities, and currently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an\nadverse effect on our financial position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities\nrequires significant judgment by our management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The\nultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for\nwhich such determination is made. Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material\nadditional tax liabilities in the future, which could impact our financial position. In addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire\nbusinesses that have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm\u2019s-length or that are otherwise\npotentially less tax efficient than our licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an\nincreased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a\nreserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Beginning on January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct (\u201cthe Act\u201d), enacted in December 2017, eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to\ncapitalize and amortize U.S.-based and non-U.S. based research and development expenditures over five and fifteen years, respectively. This legislation has\naccelerated the utilization of our net operating losses in the U.S., but it has not impacted our current tax obligations.\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (\u201cthe IRA\u201d) was enacted to take into effect for tax years after December 31, 2022. It introduced a corporate\nalternative minimum tax (\u201cCAMT\u201d) equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income for large corporations with profits in excess of $1 billion and a 1%\nexcise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations that would be imposed on such corporations. While pending further guidance, it is possible that the\nIRA could increase our future tax liability, which could in turn adversely impact our business and future profitability.\nWe are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our\nbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability that\nwe have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where\nwe have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potential\nchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We could\nbecome subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental\nbodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and\nhistorically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax\nobligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expanding\nscale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our\nfinancial position, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $1.9 billion that begin to expire in 2031 and $12.1 billion that have an\nunlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $9.4 billion that started expiring in 2022 and $2.0\nbillion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2022, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $633 million that begin to expire in\n2023 and $17.7 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. Realization of these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and\nthere is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely\naffect our operating results. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater\nthan 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net operating\nloss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-ownership change income may be\nlimited. Many U.S. states follow similar rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership change. We may experience ownership changes in the future\nbecause of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss\ncarryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased\nfuture tax liability to us.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nBecause we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated\nfinancial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect\nour overall financial results. We have not to date, but\n32may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our\noperating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have limited experience establishing hedging\nprograms, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we\nacquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest\nportions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies. Competition\nwithin our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be\nable to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such\ntarget may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.\nFurther, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.\nWe may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of\navailable cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate\nand execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and\noperating results may be harmed.\nIn addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and\ntechnologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and\nexpansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies\nregarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and\ndoing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing\nsignificant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. The process of integrating an acquired\ncompany, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022 diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;\n\u2022 disrupting our ongoing business operations;\n\u2022 platform user acceptance of the acquired company\u2019s offerings;\n\u2022 implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;\n\u2022 integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;\n\u2022 retaining and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing cultural\ndifferences between acquired businesses and our business, as well as managing costs associated with eliminating redundancies or transferring\nemployees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption;\n\u2022 maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;\n\u2022 integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\n\u2022 integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;\n\u2022 liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company;\n\u2022 litigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and\n\u2022 impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.\nWe have in the past and may in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company\u2019s operating functions. For example,\nwith respect to the integration of Careem and Drizly, each company\u2019s brand, product app(s) and payments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber\u2019s apps and\neach company\u2019s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operate independently and report to such company\u2019s own Chief Executive\nOfficer. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or\nreputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar laws outside the United\nStates. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage\n33corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these transactions will be\naccretive to the value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, joint ventures, or other strategic transactions we\nannounce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or regulators, any or all of which may adversely affect our reputation and our\nbusiness. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our\nbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model has\nbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such\njurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements\nor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or\nlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an\nexisting license or permit.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us\nto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations\nhave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council\nvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire\nvehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform; the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in November 2019, a\nballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1,\n2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in\nOctober 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and\nother jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for\nminimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries\noutside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that\nwe believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease\noperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our\nbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used\nthe Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal\nchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our\nfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled\nthat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched\nMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in\ncertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\nofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to\ncontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this\npractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our\nlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future\ncontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decision\nas a gesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers\u2019 defense costs, which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of dollars.\nFurthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could\nadversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally,\n34that have favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle\ncertifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge\npricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in\naccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to\ncomply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 70 countries. We are subject to differing, and\nsometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,\nregional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business\nmodel. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how\nwe operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be\nadopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and\nregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-\nmarket in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that\nlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively\nchallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing\nservices. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb\nair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the\ninstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect\nin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition\nto electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to\nhave been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to\nshare certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordance\nwith these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt on\neither a temporary or indefinite basis.\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest\nthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform\nusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related\nto, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product\nliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court\nof Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions of\nAustralia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.\nThese legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in\nfinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which\ncould harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,\nrevenue, and operating results.\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access to\ndockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other\nMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The\noccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative\npublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\n35Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of\nanti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too\nhigh (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our\nbusiness, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or\nfines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose\nsignificant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including\nlimitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and,\ntherefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\noperating results.\nWe expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus\non the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an\ninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit\nour future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that\ncertain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our\nsubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money\ninstitution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money\nremittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We\ncontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support\nthe future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business\noperations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or\nlimit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other\nenforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are\nrequired to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may\nblock payments to Drivers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and\ninvolve substantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to\nStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate\neach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our\nplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our\nplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,\nand prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not\ncompleting all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received\nby those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment\nprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined\nwith changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments\nregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money\nlaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. Effective\nJuly 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by the\nEuropean payments regulations.\n36In addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to money\ntransmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds\ntransfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export\nrestrictions. Our business operations, including our payments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations.\nHistorical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets, or\nother enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on our\nability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,\nand payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering\nand sanctions laws, and in the EEA to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider.\nGovernment authorities may seek to bring legal action against us if our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk\nmanagement or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to our\nbusiness.\nWe currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, other federal, state and local government\nagencies and other foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.\nWe are the subject of DOJ inquiries and investigations, as well as enforcement inquiries and investigations by other federal, state and local government\nagencies and other regulators abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including but not limited to, our business practices, such as\nfees, pricing, and related disclosures, relationships with third parties, and data privacy and security incidents. For example, in September 2018, after investigations\nand various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated\njudgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered\ninto a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach with the FTC, which the FTC Commissioners approved in October\n2018. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. In\naddition, in July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of the 2016 Breach. The 2016\nBreach has led to, and it, as well as other security incidents we experience, may continue to lead to, costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and\nlitigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. Investigations and\nenforcement actions from such entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely\ndisrupt our business. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber B.V. were each fined \u20ac2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for\nalleged privacy violations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018.\nWe are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and other\ncountries.\nThese government inquiries and investigations are time-consuming and require a great deal of financial resources and attention from us and our senior\nmanagement. If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced to\nchange our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional\nreputational harm, and could result in or complicate other inquiries, investigations, or lawsuits from other regulators in future merger control or conduct\ninvestigations. Any of these developments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,\nlegislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.\nThese and any past or future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection, and other laws.\nSuch violations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local\nregulatory entities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have\nbeen the subject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree\npursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent\nhow we protect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other\nactivities, future failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling\napproximately $1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered\ninto a settlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In addition, in September\n2018, we entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states\n37and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and\nprivacy practices. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber B.V. were each fined \u20ac2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for\nalleged privacy violations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018. Additionally, in July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the\nDOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of the 2016 Breach. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement\nactions, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the\ncompanies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had\nbeen subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem\nbecomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we\nexperience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been\nsubject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final\ncourt approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. Moreover, in January 2023, the FTC announced a final order relating to the data security\nincident. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate\nthis or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance\nprograms may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and\ninternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy\nand security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The\nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special\ncategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\nindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and\nharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provided new privacy rights for consumers and\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\nstates have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil\nprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.\nThese laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights\nAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received\nheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have undergone modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on\nthe adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United\nStates. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to\ntransfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a\nrequirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a\nfailure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions\nagainst us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user\ndata with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use,\nsharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain\njurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on\neither a temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local\ncomputation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely\naffect the manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our\n38operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus\ncompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,\ndisclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived\nfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by\nindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if\nfound liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If\nany of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our\nability to operate our business.\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal\nproceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, Carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are\nsubject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers\u2019 tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual\nproperty infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such\nlitigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time\nconsuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal\nproceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to\nchange the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process\nfor all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become\nmore costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to\nour reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future\nvoluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our\nlitigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by\nplatform users and employees.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules\nbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of\nprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we\ncould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,\ninvestigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA\nand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties\nfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to\nadditional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of\ncorruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers, employees, consultants, or\nbusiness partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our\nacquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be\nfamiliar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and\ncompliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held\nresponsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the\nidentity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.\n39Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our\nplatform.\nMany Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific\nregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be\nlicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers\nmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of\nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations\nthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become\nsubject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract\nDrivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual\nplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages\nfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. These lawsuits are\nexpensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our\nbusiness practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or\nother claims challenging these practices.\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance\ncarriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects\nof our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our\nMobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist\ncoverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a\nlimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot\nguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other\nautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general\nliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner\nunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and\nCanada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant\nadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the\nrisk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our\ninsurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by\nus through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and\nindustry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have\nrequirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our\nunrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who\nuse our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings\non our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability\ninsurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to\nhave been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result\nin liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid\nclaims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative\npublicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or\n40actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect\nto ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.\nFurther, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key\ncontracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage\ncould result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties\nand negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our\nbusiness.\nWe may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.\nOur revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have\nbeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate\nconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.\nFurther, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.\nAdditional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the\nsubject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings\n(including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of\nmunicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a\nresult, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of\nothers, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware\ndesigns, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent\napplications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we\ndo not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers could devalue\nour products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,\nand disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as\nappropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,\nand distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may\nnot be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we currently or in the future\nwill operate. In addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our products and offerings or obtain and use the content of our website\nwithout authorization. Further, we may be unable to prevent competitors or other third parties from acquiring or using domain names or trademarks that are similar\nto, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our domain names, trademarks, service marks, and other proprietary rights. Moreover, our trade secrets may be\ncompromised by third parties or our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage derived from the compromised trade secrets. Further, we\nmay be unable to detect infringement of our intellectual property rights, and even if we detect such violations and decide to enforce our intellectual property rights,\nwe may not be successful, and may incur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, any such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert\nmanagement\u2019s attention. Further, such enforcement efforts may result in a ruling that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to\nprotect or any loss of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\noperating results.\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders, including \u201cnon-practicing entities,\u201d seeking to profit from\nroyalties in connection with grants of licenses or seeking to obtain injunctions, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and\nfrequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have and may in the future continue to\nreceive notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed upon other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nFurthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas in which we historically have not operated, which could increase\nour exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims. In addition, we, and companies we acquired or in which we have an interest, have been sued, and may\nin the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual property infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we have\nan interest loses rights to valuable intellectual property or is found to infringe third party intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our investment\nmay materially decline.\n41Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management\u2019s\nattention and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and may\nresult in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. Further, certain adverse\noutcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.\nWe may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant royalties or license fees, which may increase our operating expenses.\nWe may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effort and\nexpense and make us less competitive. If we cannot license or develop alternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringing\naspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of these results\ncould harm our operating results.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles.\nThe accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our business\nmodel, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in SEC or other agency policies, rules,\nregulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model and accounting methods could result in changes to our financial\nstatements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in\nmaterially different financial results, and may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting\ncontrols.\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conduct their\nbusiness activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constitute\ninvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe that\nwe are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed an\ninvestment company, such a determination would require us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply with restrictions imposed by the\nInvestment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would have\nan adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the\nrequirements of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assets\nand pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance,\nand we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or\npart of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Gross Bookings, revenue, or other operating and financial\nresults;\n\u2022 announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the number of Drivers and consumers on our platform;\n\u2022 variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of our management, securities analysts, investors, the financial community;\n\u2022 changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect financial results;\n\u2022 actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our\ncompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or\ncapital commitments;\n\u2022 negative media coverage or publicity;\n\u2022 changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies generally, or those in our\n42industry in particular, including our competitors;\n\u2022 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022 lawsuits threatened, filed, or decided against us;\n\u2022 developments in legislation or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies (including any competition\nauthorities blocking, delaying, or subjecting our pending acquisitions to significant limitations or restrictions on our ability to operate in one or more\nmarkets, or requiring us to divest our or any target company\u2019s assets or businesses in one or more markets);\n\u2022 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022 any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022 any safety incidents or public reports of safety incidents that occur on our platform or in our industry;\n\u2022 statements, commentary, or opinions by public officials that our product offerings are or may be unlawful, regardless of any interim or final rulings by\njudicial or regulatory bodies; and\n\u2022 other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns or epidemics, pandemics,\nnatural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies\u2019 stock prices. Often, their\nstock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class\naction litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state and\nfederal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with our IPO. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and\nseriously harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to decline significantly, and\nthere can be no assurance that our stock price would recover. As such, you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid, and you may lose\nsome or all of your investment.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common\nstock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem\nadvantageous. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or\nremoval of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available for stockholder consideration;\n\u2022 limitations on stockholder ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to adopt desired\ngovernance changes;\n\u2022 prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and\n\u2022 our board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board of\ndirectors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the\nprice that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. In addition, under our existing debt instruments, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are subject\nto certain limitations on our business and operations, including limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. For information regarding these\nand other provisions, see the risk factor titled \u201c-We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment\nobligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\u201d\nSales, directly or indirectly, of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\n43Sales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public perception that these sales might occur, could depress the\nmarket price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We may issue our shares of common\nstock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments\nor otherwise. Such issuances, including the issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of such equity awards, could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of\nour business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain of our existing debt instruments include\nrestrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our\ncommon stock increases.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following\ntypes of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\u2022 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022 any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022 any action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022 any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022 any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\n\u2022 any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts\nhave exclusive jurisdiction.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for\nresolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of\nthe enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although the Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provisions are facially valid, courts\nin other jurisdictions may find such provisions to be unenforceable.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If any other court of competent\njurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may\nincur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of\nour financial reports, and the market price of our common stock may be harmed.\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure\nto maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\nThe process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly and\nchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size\nand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required\nfor a public company. During the evaluation and\n44testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert\nthat our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growth\nofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain\ninternal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to\nconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material\nweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market\nprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC\nor other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other\neffective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nAs of December 31, 2022, we leased and owned office facilities around the world totaling 9.2 million square feet, including 2.3 million square feet for our\ncorporate headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, California.\nWe believe our facilities, which are generally used by all of our reportable segments, are adequate and suitable for our current needs and that should it be\nneeded, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar or other actions could be brought against us in the future. The most\nsignificant of these matters are described below.\nLegal Proceedings Described in Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 contained in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies for financial reporting purposes that could have a material adverse\neffect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations if they were resolved in a manner that is adverse to us. This item should be read in\nconjunction with Note 14 for information regarding the following material legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this item by reference:\n\u2022Driver Classification\n\u2022State Unemployment Taxes\nLegal Proceedings That Are Not Described in Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn addition to the matters that are identified in Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and incorporated into this item by reference, the following matters also constitute material\npending legal proceedings, other than ordinary course litigation incidental to our business, to which we are or any of our subsidiaries is a party.\nAustralia Class Actions\nIn May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf of\ncertain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the\nperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The\nclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of\ncertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny\nthese allegations and intend to continue to vigorously defend against the lawsuits. A trial has been scheduled to commence in February 2024.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the\nmatters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be\nmaterial to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal\nproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related\nto the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside\n45the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and\ngovernment investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably\nlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal\nproceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly\ndefense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\u2019S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information for Common Stock\nOur common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) under the symbol \u201cUBER\u201d since May 10, 2019. Prior to that date, there was\nno public trading market for our common stock.\nHolders of our Common Stock\nAs of February 15, 2023, there were 1,457 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record\nholders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the development\nand expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The terms of certain of our outstanding\ndebt instruments restrict our ability to pay dividends or make distributions on our common stock, and we may enter into credit agreements or other borrowing\narrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends or make distributions on our capital stock. Any future determination\nregarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including\nour financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem\nrelevant.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nIn November 2022, we issued 72 shares of our common stock to holders of Careem Convertible Notes who elected to convert the balance of such notes to\ncommon stock at a conversion price of $55 per share. The shares were exempt from registration pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act.\nPerformance Graph\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed \u201csoliciting material\u201d or to be \u201cfiled\u201d with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise\nsubject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Uber Technologies, Inc. under the Securities\nAct, or the Exchange Act.\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total return to stockholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index, (\u201cS&P 500\u201d), and the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index (\u201cS&P 500 IT\u201d). An investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all\ndividends) is assumed to have been made in our common stock and in each index on May 10, 2019, the date our common stock began trading on the NYSE, and its\nrelative performance is tracked through December 31, 2022. The returns shown are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance.\n46ITEM 6. [RESERVED]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial\nstatements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have\nelected to omit discussion on the earliest of the three years covered by the consolidated financial statements presented. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed on\nFebruary 24, 2022, for reference to discussion of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented.\nIn addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates,\nand beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements and in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, for a discussion of factors that\ncould cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and\nanalysis and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A\nto point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of\nride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight\nindustry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologies\ndesigned to provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the\nalleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n47On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of\nProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,\nwhich was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California\nCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument was heard and\nwe await a decision.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) Employment\nTribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather\nthan independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able\nto take trips, based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed\nto the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK\ndrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring\ntheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving\nwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement\nprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement\nof historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are\nnot already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place for claimants who\nhave not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the\nenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.\nIf, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we\nwould incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including\nminimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential\npenalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,\nand we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, result of\noperations, financial position, and cash flows.\nFor a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating\ncondition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled \u201c-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-\nemployees\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part\nII, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of\nrevenue, incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d and the section titled \u201cCritical Accounting\nEstimates\u201d in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n48Financial and Operational Highlights\nYear Ended December 31, Constant Currency \n(In millions, except per centages) 2021 20222021 to 2022 %\nChange 2021 to 2022 % Change\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers (\u201cMAPCs\u201d) 118 131 11 %\nTrips 6,368 7,642 20 %\nGross Bookings $ 90,415 $ 115,395 28 % 33 %\nRevenue $ 17,455 $ 31,877 83 % 90 %\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. $ (496)$ (9,141) **\nMobility Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,596 $ 3,299 107 %\nDelivery Adjusted EBITDA $ (348)$ 551 **\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (774)$ 1,713 **\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (445)$ 642 **\nFree cash flow $ (743)$ 390 **\n See the section titled \u201cReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure.\n See the section titled \u201cCertain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for more information.\n MAPCs presented for annual periods are MAPCs for the fourth quarter of the year.\n Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. included stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n Net cash used in operating activities and free cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2021 reflected a $1.0 billion cash inflow related to a legacy\nauto insurance transfer. For additional information on the legacy auto insurance transfer, refer to Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K as well as the section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for more information.\nNet cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2022 reflected an approximately $733 million (GBP 613\nmillion) cash outflow related to the resolution of all outstanding HMRC VAT claims that were paid during the fourth quarter of 2022. For additional information on\nthis matter, refer to Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and\nSupplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\n** Percentage not meaningful.\nHighlights for 2022\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, our MAPCs were 131 million, growing 7 million, or 6%, quarter-over-quarter, and growing 11% compared to the same period in\n2021.\nOverall Gross Bookings increased by $25.0 billion in 2022, up 28%, or 33% on a constant currency basis, compared to 2021. Mobility Gross Bookings grew\n48% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic\n(\u201cCOVID-19\u201d). Delivery Gross Bookings grew 14% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth in the US & Canada. Freight Gross\nBookings grew 226% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily attributable to the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in the fourth\nquarter of 2021.\nRevenue was $31.9 billion, or up 83% year-over-year. Revenue growth outpaced Gross Bookings growth primarily due to a $4.8 billion increase in our Freight\nbusiness primarily due to the acquisition of Transplace during the fourth quarter of 2021, the net favorable impact to Mobility revenue of $3.9 billion as a result of\nbusiness model changes in the UK and accruals made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers, and an $892 million\nincrease in Delivery revenue resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation\nand amortization, for certain markets where we are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $9.1 billion, which includes the unfavorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized loss on debt and equity\nsecurities, net, of $7.0 billion primarily related to changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities, including: a $3.0 billion net unrealized loss on our\nAurora investments, a $2.1 billion net unrealized loss on our Grab investment, a $1.0 billion net unrealized loss on our Didi investment, a $747 million change of\nfair value on our Zomato investment, as well as a(1)\n(2), (3)\n(2)\n(2)\n(4)\n(1), (2)\n(5)\n(1), (5)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n49$142 million net unrealized loss on other investments. Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also included $1.8 billion of stock-based compensation\nexpense.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1.7 billion, growing $2.5 billion compared to 2021. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit was $3.3 billion, up $1.7 billion compared to\n2021. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit was $551 million, up $899 million from Delivery Adjusted EBITDA loss of $348 million in 2021.\nWe ended the year with $4.3 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nOther Developments\nCOVID-19\nCOVID-19 rapidly changed market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business,\nresults of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Various governmental restrictions, including the declaration of a federal National Emergency, multiple\ncities\u2019 and states\u2019 declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings,\nand other measures have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations. For example, we temporarily suspended our shared rides\noffering globally, and continue to offer \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings. We also responded to COVID-19 by launching new, or expanding\nexisting, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.\nFurthermore, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, Driver supply constraints. For a discussion of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows refer to Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded that we are an agent in these\narrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver\nincentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\nIn 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of Mobility services to end-users in\nthose markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to provide\ntransportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for Mobility services, we present\nrevenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in exchange for Mobility services\nare recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,\u201d \u201cNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue\nRecognition,\u201d and \u201cNote 2 \u2013 Revenue\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit\ncard processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation\nservices, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are\nprimarily responsible for Mobility or Delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip\nvolume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located\ndata center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer\nsupport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an\nabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\n50Sales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising\ncosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of\ncertain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the\nforeseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and\nproduct development. Expenses includes ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business in January 2021,\nas well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We\nexpense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and\ndevelopment activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs, offset by a\ndecrease in investments in our ATG and Other Technology Programs subsequent to the sale of our ATG Business in 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and\nadministrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as\nallocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an\nabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal\nsupport functions.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software,\nleasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements,\ncomputer and network equipment, leased vehicles, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our\ncapitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount. For additional detail related\nto our debt obligations, see \u201cNote 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:\n\u2022Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.\n\u2022Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated\nin currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.\n\u2022Gain on business divestitures, net.\n\u2022Gain from sale of investments, which consists primarily of gain from the sale of our entire equity interest in the Yandex Self Driving Group B.V.

These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax\nrates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will\nvary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and\nchanges in tax laws.\nEquity Method Investments\nEquity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022\nRevenue $ 17,455 $ 31,877 \nCosts and expenses\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below 9,351 19,659 \nOperations and support 1,877 2,413 \nSales and marketing 4,789 4,756 \nResearch and development 2,054 2,798 \nGeneral and administrative 2,316 3,136 \nDepreciation and amortization 902 947 \nTotal costs and expenses 21,289 33,709 \nLoss from operations (3,834) (1,832)\nInterest expense (483) (565)\nOther income (expense), net 3,292 (7,029)\nLoss before income taxes and income (loss) from equity method investments (1,025) (9,426)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes (492) (181)\nIncome (loss) from equity method investments (37) 107 \nNet loss including non-controlling interests (570) (9,138)\nLess: net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax (74) 3 \nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. $ (496)$ (9,141)\n52The following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented as a percentage of revenue :\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022\nRevenue 100 % 100 %\nCosts and expenses\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below 54 % 62 %\nOperations and support 11 % 8 %\nSales and marketing 27 % 15 %\nResearch and development 12 % 9 %\nGeneral and administrative 13 % 10 %\nDepreciation and amortization 5 % 3 %\nTotal costs and expenses 122 % 106 %\nLoss from operations (22)% (6)%\nInterest expense (3)% (2)%\nOther income (expense), net 19 % (22)%\nLoss before income taxes and income (loss) from equity method investments (6)% (30)%\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes (3)% (1)%\nIncome (loss) from equity method investments \u2014 % \u2014 %\nNet loss including non-controlling interests (3)% (29)%\nLess: net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax \u2014 % \u2014 %\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.

The increase in\nGross Bookings was primarily driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and a $4.8 billion increase in\nFreight Gross Bookings resulting primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, we saw a $3.9 billion net increase in\nMobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK and accruals made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of\ndrivers. We also saw an $892 million increase in Delivery revenue resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of\nrevenue, exclusive of depreciation and

Mobility revenue also had a net increase of $3.9 billion from business model changes in the UK and accruals made for the resolution of\nhistorical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers.\nMobility adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility revenue, partially offset by a $1.4 billion increase in insurance\nexpense as a result of an increase in miles driven and a $298 million increase in credit card processing costs.\nDelivery Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Delivery revenue increased $2.5 billion, or 30% and Delivery adjusted\nEBITDA grew $899 million, or 258%.\nDelivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 14%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in\nfood delivery orders and higher basket sizes. Delivery Take Rate improved to 19.5% from 16.2% compared to the same period in 2021 driven by an overall\nimprovement in basket sizes and increase in orders. Additionally, we saw an $892 million increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in\ncertain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for certain markets where we are primarily\nresponsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.\nDelivery Adjusted EBITDA improvement is primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery revenue, partially offset by (i) a $1.6 billion increase in cost of\nrevenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, driven by a $1.4 billion increase in Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue for\ncertain markets where we are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided, and (ii) a $231 million increase in employee\nheadcount costs.\nFreight Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Freight revenue increased $4.8 billion, or 226% and Freight adjusted\nEBITDA grew $130 million, or 100%.\nFreight revenue increased primarily attributable to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue is\nalso driven by the growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top Shippers.\nFreight adjusted EBITDA improvement is attributable to a $4.8 billion improvement in Freight revenue, partially offset by (i) $4.3 billion of certain Shipper\npayments recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, mainly due to a $3.3(1)\n(2), (3)\n(4)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3) \n(4)\n57billion increase in Freight Carrier payments resulting from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021, and (ii) a $329 million increase in employee\nheadcount costs.\nAll Other\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, All Other revenue decreased $8 million, or 100% and All Other adjusted\nEBITDA grew $11 million, or 100%.\nAll Other revenue decreased and All Other adjusted EBITDA grew primarily due to the favorable impact of the sale of our ATG Business in the first quarter of\n2021.\nCertain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA and revenue growth rates in constant currency are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information about how we use these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures in our business, the limitations of these measures, and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures, see the section titled \u201cReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers. MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Delivery\norder on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our\nplatform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of\ntransactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility or New Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberX\nShare ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a\nuseful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\n58Gross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility rides; Delivery orders (in each\ncase without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds); Driver and Merchant earnings; Driver incentives and Freight revenue. Gross Bookings do not\ninclude tips earned by Drivers. Gross Bookings are an indication of the scale of our current platform, which ultimately impacts revenue.\n(In millions) Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021 Q1 2022 Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Q4 2022\nMobility $ 6,773 $ 8,640 $ 9,883 $ 11,340 $ 10,723 $ 13,364 $ 13,684 $ 14,894 \nDelivery 12,461 12,912 12,828 13,444 13,903 13,876 13,684 14,315 \nFreight 302 348 402 1,082 1,823 1,838 1,751 1,540 \nTake Rate is defined as revenue as a percentage of Gross Bookings.\nAdjusted EBITDA.

In addition to revenue, net income\n(loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow,\nwhich are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our\nperformance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.\nWe believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when\nplanning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to our historical\nperformance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key\nmetrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help\nthem analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer\n59companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with\nGAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss)\nattributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest\nexpense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory\nreserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii)\nrestructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related\npayments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver\nreimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and\nothers in need as well as charitable donations.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating\nperformance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted\nEBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team\nand board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash\nexpenses and certain variable charges. To help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, we are excluding\nthe impacts of COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal\nprotective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and\nfood deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA. Our board and management find the\nexclusion of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the impact of\nthese response initiatives on our results of operations.\nCOVID-19 Response Initiatives\nTo support those whose earning opportunities have been depressed as a result of COVID-19, as well as communities hit hard by the pandemic, we have\nannounced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of\npersonal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free\nrides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations. The payments for financial assistance to Drivers\npersonally impacted by COVID-19 and Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue.\nThe cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need\nas well as charitable donations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.\nLimitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related\nfinancial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and\nalthough these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not\nreflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring\nexpense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments\nfor financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver\nreimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors,\nand others in need as well as charitable donations;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchange\ngains (losses), net; gain (loss) on business divestitures, net; and unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net; and impairment of debt and equity\nsecurities; and\n60\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.\n The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to\nAdjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2022\nAdjusted EBITDA reconciliation:\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. $ (496)$ (9,141)\nAdd (deduct):\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax (74) 3 \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes (492) (181)\n(Income) loss from equity method investments 37 (107)\nInterest expense 483 565 \nOther (income) expense, net (3,292) 7,029 \nDepreciation and amortization 902 947 \nStock-based compensation expense 1,168 1,793 \nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements 526 732 \nGoodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets 157 25 \nAcquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses 102 46 \nAccelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets 5 6 \nCOVID-19 response initiatives 54 1 \nLoss on lease arrangement, net \u2014 7 \nRestructuring and related charges, net \u2014 2 \nLegacy auto insurance transfer 103 \u2014 \nMass arbitration fees, net 43 (14)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (774)$ 1,713 \n For further information, refer to Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConstant Currency\nWe compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant\ncurrency growth rate information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying revenue performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate\nfluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating our current period financial results using the corresponding prior period\u2019s monthly exchange rates for\nour transacted currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for each of the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2022\nFree cash flow reconciliation:\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (445)$ 642 \nPurchases of property and equipment (298) (252)\nFree cash flow $ (743)$ 390 \n Net cash used in operating activities and free cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2021 reflected a $1.0 billion cash inflow related to a legacy\nauto insurance transfer. For additional information on the legacy auto insurance transfer, refer to the section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for more\ninformation.(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n61Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2022 reflected a cash outflow of approximately $733 million\n(GBP 613 million) related to the resolution of outstanding HMRC VAT claims that were paid during the fourth quarter of 2022. For additional information on this\nmatter, refer to Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and\nSupplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2022\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (445)$ 642 \nNet cash used in investing activities (1,201) (1,637)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 1,780 15 \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $642 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $9.1 billion of net loss, adjusted for\ncertain non-cash items, which primarily included $7.0 billion in unrealized losses from equity securities, $1.8 billion of stock-based compensation expense, and\n$947 million depreciation and amortization expense as well as a $335 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital. The decrease in cash consumed by\nworking capital was primarily driven by an increase in our insurance reserves and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts\nreceivable. Net cash provided by operating activities reflects a cash outflow of approximately $733 million (GBP 613 million) related to the resolution of\noutstanding HMRC VAT claims that were paid during the fourth quarter of 2022. For additional information on this matter, refer to Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $445 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $570 million of net loss, adjusted for\ncertain non-cash items, which primarily included $1.7 billion in gain on business divestitures, $1.2 billion of stock-based compensation expense, $1.1 billion of\nunrealized gain on debt and equity securities, $413 million of gain from sale of investments, depreciation and amortization expense of $902 million, as well as a\n$477 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily driven\nby an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, an increase in our insurance reserves, partially offset by higher accounts receivable and prepaid expenses\nand lower operating lease liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities also reflects a $1.0 billion cash inflow related to legacy auto insurance transfer. For\nadditional information on the legacy auto insurance transfer, see Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part\nII, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $1.7 billion in purchases of marketable\nsecurities, $252 million in purchases of property and equipment, and $59 million in acquisition of business, net of cash acquired, partially offset by proceeds from\nmaturities and sales of marketable securities of $376 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $2.3 billion in acquisition of businesses,\nnet of cash acquired, $1.1 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $982 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $297 million in purchases of\nnotes receivable, and $298 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $2.3\nbillion, proceeds from the sale of equity method investments of $1.0 billion and proceeds from sale of non-marketable equity securities of $500 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily consisting of proceeds from sale of subsidiary\nstock units of $255 million, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $92 million, partially offset by $184\nmillion of principal payments on finance leases, and $80 million of principal repayment on the non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the\nacquisition of Careem (\u201cCareem Notes\u201d).\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $1.5 billion of proceeds from\nissuance of notes, net of issuance costs, $675 million of proceeds from issuance of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $307 million of principal\nrepayment on Careem Notes and $226 million principal payments on finance leases.\nOther Information\nAs of December 31, 2022, $2.4 billion of our $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the United\nStates may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result in\nimmaterial tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the\n62United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of\nDecember 31, 2022, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to\nsatisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, collateral requirements, potential acquisitions,\npotential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (\u201cpay-to-play\u201d), and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We intend to\ncontinue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidity.\nNon-Income Tax Matters\nOn October 31, 2022, we resolved all outstanding HMRC (the tax regulator in the UK) VAT claims related to periods prior to our model change on March 14,\n2022. There was not a material impact to our statement of operations as we had adequate reserves recorded related to this resolution. During the fourth quarter of\n2022, we made a payment of approximately $733 million (GBP 613 million) for this resolution. For additional information, see Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies in the section titled \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCommitments\nLeases\nOur operating lease portfolio primarily consists of corporate offices. For additional information, see Note 6 - Leases in the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLong-Term Debt\nWe have long-term debt with varying maturities dates through 2029. For additional information, see Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit\nArrangements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nPurchase Commitments\nWe have non-cancelable commitments which primarily relate to network and cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amounts\nare determined based on the non-cancelable quantities to which we are contractually obligated.\nIn November 2022, we entered into commercial technology agreements with vendors for cloud computing services (\u201c2022 Cloud Computing Service\nAgreements\u201d). We are committed to spend an aggregate of at least $2.9 billion through November 2029, of which $160 million is short-term. We may pay more\nthan the minimum purchase commitment to our cloud-computing web services providers based on usage. As of December 31, 2022, the amounts utilized for these\nagreements are immaterial.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $3.2 billion in non-cancelable commitments, this includes the $2.9 billion in 2022 Cloud Computing Service Agreements\ndiscussed above. The non-cancellable commitments have varying expiration terms through November 2029.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to understanding and evaluating our\nconsolidated financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting\nestimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have\nbeen used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various\nother assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of\nassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty\ninvolved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements. For additional information, see the disclosure included in Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products and\nDelivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with\nend-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. In certain markets, we also generate revenue from end-users and charge a direct\nfee for use of the platform and in exchange for\n63Mobility and Delivery services. With exception of these markets, end-users are not our customers because end-users access our platform for free and we have no\nperformance obligation to end-users.\nJudgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and\nare the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). We have\nconcluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery\ntransactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and\nincentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\nIn certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting\nagainst any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,\nuncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\nDriver Incentives\nWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided to\ncustomers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service\nreceived. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate\nclassification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions\nwhich are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated\nfair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such\nvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,\nand trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful\nlives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nDuring the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nwith the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nInvestments\u2014Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities\nWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which we\ndo not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and\nare subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.\nInvestments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with\nthe changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for\ninvestments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.\nInvestments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires\njudgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated\nfair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing\ntransactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar\nto the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\nWe assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity\nsecurities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an\nequity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying\n64value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for\nimpairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not\nrequired to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the\nconsolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists,\nwe then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to\nwhich fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To\ndetermine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the\nsecurity\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized\ncost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline\nin fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in\ncredit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but\nnot a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we\nrecognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities\u2019 net\nincome or loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities\u2019 net income or loss one quarter in\narrears. Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in\nearnings.\nWe review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the\ninvestment may not be fully recoverable. Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and\noperating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee\u2019s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the\ninvestment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined\nand an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly for\ninvestments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions. Changes in these estimates and\nassumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment charges.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be\nimpaired. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying\nvalues for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers review\nfinancial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,\nbusiness, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting\nthe reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test\nis then performed.\nPerforming a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and\nassumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,\nrisk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations, or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the\nordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we\nbelieve that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the\nloss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based\n65on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future events.\nThe outcomes of litigation, regulatory, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were\nresolved against us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular\nreporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The\nestablishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine\nthe fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and\nexpense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected\nfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and\nexternal comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be\nsustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making\njudgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax\noutcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent\nthat the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax\nrate in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition,\nwe are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly\nassess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the\npotential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers\u2019\ncompensation. The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the\nultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not\nreported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and\nloss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which\nconsider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new\ninformation becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.\nAll estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the\ninsurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results\ndepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,\nand social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near\nterm from the estimated amounts.\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of our\nboard of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstanding RSUs, as\nwell as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards contains service-\nbased vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for the\nmajority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of\n66certain financial and operation metrics. The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.\nWe account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accounting\nstandards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account\nfor forfeitures when they occur.\nWe have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-\nScholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest\nrates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\n\u2022Expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.\n\u2022Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n\u2022Expected volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of\nour own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter than\nthe expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.\n\u2022Expected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculation on a\nprospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term,\nwhich could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\nour consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point\nincrease or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $232 million\nas of December 31, 2022.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nMarketable debt securities classified as restricted investments and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022,\nour cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government\nagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate\nsecurities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A\nhypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and\nrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value\ngiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These\ninvestments in privately-held affiliates and\n67recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain\ncases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments and restricted investments.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\nthe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified\nacross geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement\nof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency\nrates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into\nderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\n68ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE\nPages\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238) 70\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 73\nConsolidated Statements of Operations 74\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss 75\nConsolidated Statements of Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests and Equity 76\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 79\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 81\nFinancial Statement Schedule\nSchedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 140\n69Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Uber Technologies, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Uber Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of redeemable non-controlling interests and equity and of cash flows for each\nof the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index\n(collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\n31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible instruments and contracts in\nan entity\u2019s own equity in 2021.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nappearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n70Critical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical\naudit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nPresentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-Users\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of the\nCompany\u2019s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged to\nend-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Mobility and Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the\nprincipal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as\nthe presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $24.9 billion and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions,\nrefunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.2 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, including\nincentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the\npresentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether\ntransaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process, including controls over the\npresentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip\ntransaction attributes and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driver\nstatements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue and\nincome statement classification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents\nthe estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount\nfor losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied\nto historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and\nexpected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed by management and\nadjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. The Company\u2019s short-term and long-term insurance reserves as of December 31, 2022\ntotaled $4.7 billion.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity\nand effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial methods and management\u2019s significant assumptions related to loss\ndevelopment patterns and expected loss costs. The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company\u2019s valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over the\ndevelopment of the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs. These procedures also included, among others, the\ninvolvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) developing, for selected reserve components, an independent actuarial estimate of\nthe insurance reserves, and comparison of this independent estimate to management\u2019s actuarially determined reserves, and (ii) testing, for other selected reserve\ncomponents, management\u2019s process for estimating the insurance reserves. Developing the independent estimate involved independently developing the loss\ndevelopment patterns and expected loss costs and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management. Testing management\u2019s process for\nestimating the insurance reserves involved evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s actuarial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant\nassumptions used by\n71management related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by\nmanagement.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 21, 2023\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2014.\n72UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE

INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a\ntechnology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects\nconsumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers\n(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and\nother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to\nas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product\nexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday\nproblems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia\n(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\n(\u201cGAAP\u201d). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d)\nwhere we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 15 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the\nreported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which\nmanagement believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of\ninvestments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of\nacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;\ncertain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual\nresults could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting\ncertain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The level of uncertainties and volatility related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic means that these\nestimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, other receivables, and accounts receivable are\npotentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits,\nU.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one\nfinancial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe\nare of high credit quality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily\nconsist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance\nclaims. We rely on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users.\nPayment service providers are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of\nrevenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\nWe have incurred significant net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $32.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. Our operations have\nhistorically been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolving\ncredit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements,\nadditional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives. We may not be able to\nobtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt\ninstruments.\n81In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic\nconditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented, including business activities and travel\nrestrictions, and \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d orders, that have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for\nMobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it continues to produce\naround the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations,\nfinancial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future\ndevelopments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be further resurgences\nof the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets;\ngovernmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all of which are\nhighly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, U.S. government and agency\nsecurities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits. We consider all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of\nthree months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants,\nwhich are included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for certain insurance policies and\nalso include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or contractual restrictions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are\nclassified as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents\nand restricted cash and cash equivalents to amounts presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,647 $ 4,295 $ 4,208 \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - current 250 631 680 \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - non-current 1,494 2,879 1,789 \nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 7,391 $ 7,805 $ 6,677 \nCollateral Held by Insurer\nCollateral held by insurer represents funds held by James River Group companies (\u201cJames River\u201d). These funds, previously held in a trust account, were\nwithdrawn by James River during the fourth quarter of 2019 upon notice of cancellation of their insurance policies (primarily auto insurance policies) issued to one\nof our subsidiaries. The funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary\u2019s current and future claim settlement obligations under the indemnification agreements\nfor these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, the amount withdrawn was presented as collateral\nheld by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, in connection with the legacy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented as\ncollateral held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held. Accordingly, the funds were reclassified from collateral held by insurer to non-\ncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.\nLegacy Auto Insurance Transfer\nOn September 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement\n(the \u201cLPTA\u201d) with James River effective July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks\nrelating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the\namount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d). Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risk\ntransfer arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator for\nongoing handling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021, and\nadverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $103 million charge in our consolidated\nstatement of operations consisting of the difference between the Premium and the assumed liabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses\nassociated with the LPTA, and the adverse development on the Transferred Claims.\n82Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable represents uncollected payments from end-users for completed transactions where (i) the payment method is credit card and includes (a)\nend-user payments not yet settled with payment service providers, and (b) end-user payments settled by payment service providers but not yet remitted to us, (ii)\ncompleted shipments where we have an unconditional right to the consideration from Freight customers (\u201cShippers\u201d) and payment has not been received or (iii)\nuncollected payments from Uber for Business organizations for completed transactions. The timing of settlement of amounts due from these parties varies by\nregion and by product. The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities. Refer to Note 9 \u2013\nSupplemental Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.\nAlthough we pre-authorize forms of payment to mitigate our exposure, we bear the cost of any accounts receivable losses. We record an allowance for doubtful\naccounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions. We\nconsider the allowance for doubtful accounts for fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are primarily included\nas cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future payments and\ngeographical trends, which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible. Chargebacks and credit card\nlosses were $178 million, $246 million and $286 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight \u2011 line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:\nProperty and Equipment Estimated Useful Life\nLand Indefinite\nBuildings 30-45 years\nSite improvements 5-15 years\nLeased vehicles 3-10 years\nComputer equipment 3-5 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3-5 years\nInternal-use software 2 years\nLeased computer equipment Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or\nloss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are\ncharged to operating expenses as incurred.\nWe capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding debt, in developing internal-\nuse software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed\nand the software will function as intended. Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and begins\nonce the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as\nincurred. In addition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.\nLeases\nWe account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 842, \u201cLeases\u201d (\u201cASC 842\u201d). We elected the \u201cpackage of practical\nexpedients,\u201d which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a\npolicy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic\nbenefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an\nasset which we do not own. Right of use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities\nare recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future\nlease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. The IBR is a\nhypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the\nlease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a\n83collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in our lease liability\ncalculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are\nrecognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is\nrecognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. As of December 31,\n2021 and 2022, less than 14% of our operating lease ROU assets related to leased assets outside of the U.S.\nAcquisitions\nWe account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d). The\npurchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the\nacquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from\nthe acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded\nin the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Business Combinations for further information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units\nexpected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign\ngoodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of\nevents or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after\nassessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\nthen additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,\ngoodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment\nloss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 \u2013 Goodwill and\nIntangible Assets for further information.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to 18 years. We review\ndefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment section. Refer to\nNote 7 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.\nInvestments\nEquity Securities\nAccounting for our equity securities varies depending on the marketability of the security and the type of investment. Our marketable equity securities in\npublicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investments\nin non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly\ntransactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whether\nnon-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.\nNon-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for\nimpairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,\nbut would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a\nsignificant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,\nor a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities. If an\nimpairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the\ninvestment. We include investments in equity\n84securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDebt Securities\nAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the\ntransaction. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair value. Investments in marketable debt securities may\ninclude U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities\nwith redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt\nsecurities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded\nin earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond\none year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt Securities\nWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (\u201cASC 326\u201d). Under ASC\n326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair\nvalue below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it\nrecovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a\ncorresponding write-down of the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-\nrelated factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis,\nchanges in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is\ncredit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis\nof the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the\nconsolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in\nother comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit\nloss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\nRestricted Investments\nAs of December 31, 2022, restricted investments on the consolidated balance sheet are comprised of marketable debt securities that may include U.S.\ngovernment and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits, which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions\npursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers. Restricted investments are classified as non-current assets as these investments are unavailable for use in\nshort-term operations due to legal and/or contractual restrictions.\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling\nfinancial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected. Investments accounted for\nunder the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the\ninvestment balance, our proportionate share of the investees\u2019 net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences. We record our share of the results of\nequity method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. We\nevaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate that\nthe carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. We recognize in the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment\nbalance, any required impairment loss. Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the\ncarrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This\nevaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent\ntransactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\nWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount\nof an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying\namount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the\nimpairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\n85Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the\nlowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    \nLevel 1    Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are\nnot active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3    Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nOur primary financial instruments include receivables, investments in debt and equity securities, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt and\nwarrants. The estimated fair value of marketable debt securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due\nto the short-term maturities of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 \u2013 Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit\nArrangements for further information.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex,\ninvolve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that an\nentity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of\nwhether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests\nin a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer to Note 15 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive our revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of our platform, on-demand\nlead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-\ndemand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate\nrevenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Mobility and Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from\ncustomers' use of Freight services.\nWe periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.\nMobility and Delivery Agreements\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we charge\nDrivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.\nThe acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us\nand the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.\nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-\nusers to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\nIn 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for Delivery services to end-users in those markets.\nWe have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each\nunder ASC 606. We recognize Delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over\nthe period of time the delivery is occurring. We recognized revenue from end-users of $91 million, $710 million, and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, associated with these Delivery transactions. We recognized cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439\nmillion, $2.4 billion, and $3.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, associated with these Delivery transactions.\n86In 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to\nDrivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip is\ncomplete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.\nIn 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of Mobility services to end-users in\nthose markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to provide\ntransportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for Mobility services, we present\nrevenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in exchange for Mobility services\nare recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nIn all markets aside from the above three scenarios, end-users are not our customers as end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance\nobligation to end-users.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentation\nof revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for other\nparties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and\nMerchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.\nFor the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or\nDelivery service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase or\notherwise obtain control of the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to\nperform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-\nusers. As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsible\nfor Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobility\nand Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not\nresult in us controlling the services provided to end-users.\nIn the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting end-users seeking Mobility and Delivery\nservices with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfully\ncompleted transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing the\nservice to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Mobility or Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Drivers to\nprovide the Mobility or Delivery services. In these markets, we are the principal for the services and present the respective Mobility and Delivery revenue on a\ngross basis because we are primarily responsible for the services.\nMobility\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfully\ncomplete a trip via the Platform. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.\nDepending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid\nby an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by\nDrivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services\nprovided. Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time\nfollowing the completion of a trip.\nIn addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We generally collect our\nservice fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods. As we\ncurrently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, we\nconcluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated\nfinancial statements until collected from Drivers.\nMobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products.\n87Delivery\nWe derive our Delivery revenue primarily from service fees paid by Couriers and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to successfully\ncomplete a meal delivery service on the platform. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as\nselect other goods. We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.\nIn the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by Couriers is the difference\nbetween the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we pay\nCouriers based on time and distance for the delivery. Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically\nreceive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.\nFreight\nWe derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers.\nBrokerage\nBrokerage revenue represents the gross amount of fees charged to Shippers for our services because we control the service provided to customers. Costs\nincurred with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transport\nfreight. We enter into contracts with Shippers that define the price for each shipment and payment terms. Our acceptance of the shipment request establishes\nenforceable rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin to\ndestination. We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless of\npayment by the Shipper. We invoice the Shipper upon satisfaction of our sole performance obligation to transport a Shipper\u2019s freight using our network of\nindependent freight carriers. We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over the\nperiod of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are\nnot material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.\nTransportation Management\nWe provide an integrated logistics and transportation service, which can include shipment planning, freight optimization, carrier assignment, load management,\nfreight audit and payment processing and other related transportation services. Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration of these services\nto transport the Shipper\u2019s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis. The majority of our transportation management revenue is recognized on a gross basis in the\namount of gross fees charged to Shippers upon satisfaction of our performance obligation because we control the service provided to customers. Costs incurred\nwith carriers for these transactions are recorded in cost of revenue. In transactions where we do not control the service provided to customers, we recognize revenue\non a net basis. Revenue is recognized as our performance obligation is satisfied, which generally represents the transit period from origin to destination by a third-\nparty carrier. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are not material. Payment for\nour services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon completion of our performance obligation.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers. For contracts where we control the service before it is\ntransferred to the Shipper, we are primarily responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper\u2019s goods, including having\ndiscretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrier that meets the Shipper\u2019s specifications. We also have pricing discretion for the price(s) charged to\nShippers and amounts paid to Carriers. Accordingly, we are the principal in these transactions. In certain arrangements, we do not control the service provided to\ncustomers as we do not have latitude in carrier selection and establishing rates with the Carrier. Revenue is recognized on a net basis for these transactions.\nContracts where we do not control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper are not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nAll Other Revenue\nAll other revenue includes revenue from immaterial sources such as New Mobility products and Advanced Technologies Group\u2019s (\u201cATG\u201d) collaboration\nrevenue.\nAdvertising Revenue\nWe derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.\nAdvertising revenue is recognized when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in the\namount billed to merchants and brands as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.\n88Incentives to Customers\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair\nvalue of the good or service received. Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable\nconsideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since\nincentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\nIncentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. We\nexpense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under\nASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount\nrecorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is established\nusing amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2021 and 2022 were immaterial.\nIn some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction. In these transactions, the resulting\nshortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discounts\nand promotions and include:\nTargeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,\nor generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or meal\ndeliveries during a limited time period. We record the cost of these discounts and promotions to end-users who are not our customers as sales and marketing\nexpenses at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.\nEnd-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform\nand the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform. These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring\nend-user. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales and\nmarketing expenses at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.\nMarket-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants to\nend-users who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market. This also includes any discounts offered under our\nsubscription offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides.\nAccordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.\nRefunds and Credits\nRefunds and credits to end-users due to end-user dissatisfaction with the Platform are recorded as marketing expenses or as a reduction of revenue depending\non whether the end-user is considered a customer based on the market. Refunds to end-users that we recover from Drivers and Merchants are recorded as a\nreduction of revenue.\nOther\nWe have elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent with specific revenue\nproducing transactions, and collected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included\nas a component of revenue or cost of revenue.\nPractical Expedients\nWe have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts\nwith an original expected length of one year or less. We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of GAAP, which requires\ncompensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures when they\noccur. The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value,\nusing appropriate valuation techniques.\nService-Based Awards\n89We record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSU(s)\u201d) on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period, which is generally four years.\nFor stock options with service-based vesting conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model,\ntypically the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest\nrates. We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own shares or\ncomparable publicly traded companies in our industry group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a\nterm equal to the expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be \u201cplain vanilla\u201d options,\nas our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the expected term for\nnon-employees\u2019 options based on the contractual term. U.S. The expected dividend yield is 0.0% as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our\ncommon stock.\nPerformance-Based Awards\nWe have granted restricted common stock awards (\u201cRSA(s)\u201d), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSAR(s)\u201d), stock options, and warrants that vest upon the\nsatisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over three or four years.\nThe performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as our financial or operating metrics, and/or the\noccurrence of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i) the closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial public\noffering (\u201cIPO\u201d). We record stock-based compensation expense for performance-based equity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an\naccelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, which is generally three or four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered\nprobable to be satisfied.\nFor performance-based awards and RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the grant date.\nFor performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model as described above for service-\nbased awards.\nMarket-Based Awards\nWe have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based conditions, performance-based\nconditions, and/or market-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over three or four years. The performance-based\nconditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-\nbased awards. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.\nFor market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including\nexpected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate the\nvolatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in its\nindustry group. We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at\nthe time of grant. Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock and\nestimated the expected capital raise percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over the\nrequisite service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparing\nthe derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite\nservice period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d)\nWe recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The ESPP provides for\ntwelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately six months. The ESPP allows eligible employees to\npurchase shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimate\nthe fair value of shares to be issued under the ESPP based on a combination of options valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We determine\nvolatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimate the expected term based on the contractual term.\nCommon Stock Fair Value\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.\n90Prior to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensive\nbusiness, finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculating\nstock-based compensation expense. We obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist the Board of Directors in determining fair value. These\ncontemporaneous third-party valuations used the methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future\ntax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position\nwhen it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on\nthe technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the consolidated statements\nof operations.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized based\non the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the\nappropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We\nregularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals\nof existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market\nconditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax\nassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We elected the tax law ordering approach in\nassessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d).\nWe have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.\nThe establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to\ndetermine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue\nand expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected\nfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external\ncomparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nExpenses\nSet forth below is a brief description of the components of our expenses:\n\u2022Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings,\ncredit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight\ntransportation services, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery\ntransactions where we are primarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\n\u2022Operations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of\ncustomer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\n\u2022Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising\ncosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the\nallocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled $1.0 billion,\n$1.7 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and\ncredits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.0 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and\n2022, respectively.\n91\u2022Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design\nand product development. Expenses includes ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business in\nJanuary 2021, as well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain\ncorporate costs.\n\u2022General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and\nadministrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well\nas allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal\nsettlements.\n\u2022Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software,\nleasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.\nRestructuring and Related Charges\nCosts associated with management-approved restructuring activities, including reductions in headcount, exiting a market or consolidation of facilities are\nrecognized when they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-lived assets (including impairment of operating lease right-\nof-use assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for right-of-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liability for employee termination\nbenefits either when it is probable that an employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has\ncommunicated the termination plan to employees and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority to approve the action,\ncommits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications and their locations, and the expected\ncompletion date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they\nwill receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be\nmade or that the plan will be withdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the\ncontract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognized\nat the cease-use date. Costs associated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing accounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting\nguidance.\nRestructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on our\nclassification policy for each category of operating expense. Personnel costs are classified based on each employee\u2019s classification, lease costs (including\nimpairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease\u2019s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived\nassets are recorded within general and administrative expenses.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries\u2019 activities. Monetary assets\nand liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect\nat the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in\nforeign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities with non-U.S.\ndollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and revenues and\nexpenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to\ncommon stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if\nall income for the period had been distributed.\nOur restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stock\nand any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable\ndividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the\npotential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers\u2019\ncompensation. The insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation\nfor risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance\nsheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.\n92In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency\ntrends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes\nknown. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be\nsettled within one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. All\nestimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the\ninsurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results\ndepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,\nand social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from the\nestimate provided on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the\nordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we\nbelieve that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the\nloss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the\nestimated amount of loss.\nThe outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved\nagainst us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting\nperiod in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\nWe recognize estimated losses from contingencies that relate to proceedings in which Drivers are the plaintiffs, or proceedings and regulatory penalties against\nDrivers for which we elect to either pay on behalf of or reimburse Drivers, as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. All other\nestimated losses from contingencies are recognized in general and administrative expenses.\nLegal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, \u201cGovernment Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,\u201d\nwhich requires disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The\nstandard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the ASU prospectively on\nJanuary 1, 2022. The additional required annual disclosures did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, \u201cBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts\nwith Customers,\u201d which requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as if it had\noriginated the contracts. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,\n2022. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this accounting standard update on January 1, 2023 and will apply the guidance prospectively for future\nacquisitions.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, \u201cFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale\nRestrictions,\u201d which clarifies that contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring fair value of equity securities and requires additional disclosures for\nequity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early\nadoption is permitted. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as the amendments align\nwith our existing policy.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, \u201cLiabilities\u2014Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program\nObligations,\u201d which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services to disclose sufficient information\nabout the program. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement\n93or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim\nperiods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on roll-forward information, which is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nNote 2 \u2013 Revenue\nThe following tables present our revenues disaggregated by offering and geographical region. Revenue by geographical region is based on where the\ntransaction occurred. This level of disaggregation takes into consideration how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected\nby economic factors (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nMobility revenue $ 6,089 $ 6,953 $ 14,029 \nDelivery revenue 3,904 8,362 10,901 \nFreight revenue 1,011 2,132 6,947 \nAll Other revenue 135 8 \u2014 \nTotal revenue $ 11,139 $ 17,455 $ 31,877 \n We offer subscription memberships to end-users including Uber One, Uber Pass, Rides Pass, and Eats Pass (\u201cSubscription\u201d). We recognize Subscription fees\nratably over the life of the pass. We allocate Subscription fees earned to Mobility and Delivery revenue on a proportional basis, based on usage for each offering\nduring the respective period.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nUnited States and Canada (\"US&CAN\") $ 6,611 $ 10,094 $ 19,474 \nLatin America (\"LatAm\") 1,295 1,417 1,978 \nEurope, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") 2,086 3,213 6,944 \nAsia Pacific (\"APAC\") 1,147 2,731 3,481 \nTotal revenue $ 11,139 $ 17,455 $ 31,877 \nRevenue\nMobility Revenue\nWe derive revenue primarily from fees paid by Mobility Drivers for the use of our platform(s) and related services to facilitate and complete Mobility services\nand, in certain markets, revenue from fees paid by end-users for connection services obtained via the platform. Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue\nstreams such as our financial partnerships products.\nAdditionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for Mobility services, fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while payments to\nDrivers in exchange for Mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nDelivery Revenue\nWe derive revenue for Delivery from Merchants\u2019 and Couriers\u2019 use of the Delivery platform and related service to facilitate and complete Delivery\ntransactions.\nAdditionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for Delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while\npayments to Couriers in exchange for Delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Delivery also includes\nadvertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by Merchants and brands in exchange for advertising services.\nFreight Revenue\nFreight revenue consists of revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition\nof Transplace, and as a result, our Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Business Combinations for\nfurther information on the Transplace acquisition.\nAll Other Revenue\nPrior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily includes collaboration revenue related to our ATG business and revenue from our New Mobility offerings and\nproducts.\nATG collaboration revenue was within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, and related to a three-year joint(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n94collaboration agreement we entered into in 2019. During the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of Apparate USA LLC (\u201cApparate\u201d or the \u201cATG\nBusiness\u201d) to Aurora Innovation, Inc. (\u201cAurora\u201d). Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures for further information.\nNew Mobility offerings and products provided users access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d),\nplatform incubator group offerings and other immaterial revenue streams. New Mobility revenue was accounted for as an operating lease as defined under ASC\n842. After the JUMP divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.\nContract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation\nContract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying our performance obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had $133 million of contract\nliabilities included in accrued and other current liabilities as well as other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized from these\ncontracts during 2020, 2021 and 2022 was not material.\nOur remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year is expected to be recognized as follows (in\nmillions):\nLess Than or Equal To 12 Months Greater Than 12 Months Total\nAs of December 31, 2022 $ 25 $ 106 $ 131 \nNote 3 \u2013 Investments and Fair Value Measurement\nInvestments\nOur investments on the consolidated balance sheets consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2021 2022\nClassified as short-term investments:\nMarketable debt securities :\nU.S. government and agency securities $ \u2014 $ 44 \nCommercial paper \u2014 46 \nCorporate bonds \u2014 13 \nShort-term investments $ \u2014 $ 103 \nClassified as restricted investments:\nMarketable debt securities :\nU.S. government and agency securities $ \u2014 $ 1,614 \nRestricted investments $ \u2014 $ 1,614 \nClassified as investments:\nNon-marketable equity securities:\nDidi $ \u2014 $ 1,802 \nOther 315 312 \nMarketable equity securities\nDidi 2,838 \u2014 \nGrab 3,821 1,726 \nAurora 3,388 364 \nOther 1,312 87 \nNotes receivable from a related party 132 110 \nInvestments $ 11,806 $ 4,401 \nExcluding marketable debt securities classified as cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents.\nThese balances include certain investments recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings due to the election of the fair value option\nof accounting for financial instruments.(1)\n(1)\n(2)\n(2), (3)\n(1) \n(2) \n95Consists of the Lime Convertible Note. Neutron Holdings, Inc. (\u201cLime\u201d) is considered a related party as a result of our investment in Lime Common Stock.\nFor further information, see the section titled \u201cLime Investments\u201d below and Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy (in\nmillions):\nAs of December 31, 2021 As of December 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFinancial Assets\nMoney market funds $ 3,214 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 3,214 $ 1,005 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 1,005 \nU.S. government and agency securities \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1,975 \u2014 1,975 \nCommercial paper \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 76 \u2014 76 \nCorporate bonds \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 15 \u2014 15 \nNon-marketable equity securities \u2014 \u2014 32 32 \u2014 \u2014 3 3 \nMarketable equity securities 11,359 \u2014 \u2014 11,359 2,177 \u2014 \u2014 2,177 \nNotes receivable from a related party \u2014 \u2014 132 132 \u2014 \u2014 110 110 \nTotal financial assets $14,573 $ \u2014 $ 164 $14,737 $ 3,182 $ 2,066 $ 113 $ 5,361 \nFinancial Liabilities\nMLU B.V.

There\nwere no impacts to our: balance of cash and cash equivalents; restricted cash and cash equivalents; restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current; financial\nposition; liquidity; results of operations; comprehensive loss; cash flows; or the change in equity. We determined this to be an immaterial error. The December 31,\n2021 balance of money market funds in the table above has been revised to $3.2 billion. As of both March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the money market funds\nbalance in the fair value level hierarchy table should have been $3.1 billion. As of December 31, 2022, the decrease in money market funds was primarily driven by\nreinvesting funds into marketable debt securities and cash deposits.\nFor further information, see Note 4 - Equity Method Investments.\nThe amortized cost of our debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis approximates fair value as of December 31, 2022. We did not record any\nmaterial unrealized gains or losses, or credit losses as of December 31, 2022. The weighted-average remaining maturity of our debt securities was less than one\nyear as of December 31, 2022.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nWe measure our cash equivalents and certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical\nunderlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less\nactive markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques\ndue to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nOur Level 3 non-marketable equity securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 primarily consist of common stock investments and redeemable preferred\nstock investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019s\nfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the\nenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by\nusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market\ndata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in\nthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the\ninvestees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.(3) \n(1)\n(2)\n(1) \n(2) \n96An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could\nresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and\nvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In the\nfuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.\nDidi Investment\nOn June 30, 2021, Didi started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, our investment in preferred shares of Didi, which was previously\naccounted for under the measurement alternative on a non-recurring basis, was converted to ordinary shares with a readily determinable fair value and therefore\nchanged to an investment measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2021, our Didi investment was classified as a marketable equity security\nwith a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For the year\nended December 31, 2021, we recognized an unrealized loss of $3.0 billion on this investment in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of\noperations.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Didi investment is classified as a non-marketable equity security and is measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis with a\nreadily available price based on significant other observable inputs (Level 2). For further information, see the section titled \u201cDidi Investment\u201d below.\nZomato Investment\nIn July 2021, Zomato Media Private Limited (\u201cZomato\u201d), in which we held preferred shares that were previously classified as non-marketable equity securities\nand accounted for under the measurement alternative on a non-recurring basis, completed its IPO in India. Accordingly, our Zomato investment was converted to\nordinary shares upon the completion of the IPO and was classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table\npresenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we\nrecognized an unrealized gain of $991 million on this investment in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31,\n2021, the carrying value of the investment was $1.1 billion. Our investment was subject to a lock-up period in which our ability to sell was restricted until July\n2022.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of $418 million of our entire stake in Zomato ordinary shares for net proceeds of $376 million and\nrecognized an immaterial loss from this transaction in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.\nAurora Investment\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora. As consideration for the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora, we received\ncommon stock in Aurora. Concurrently, we invested in Aurora\u2019s preferred stock. For further information, refer to Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures.\nWe held one seat on Aurora\u2019s board of directors and had the ability to hold a second seat, which, along with our common and preferred stock ownership (our\n\u201cAurora Investments\u201d) generate significant influence. We elected to apply the fair value option to our Aurora common stock and preferred stock investments in\norder to provide consistency of accounting treatment to our Aurora Investments. The Aurora Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with\nchanges in fair value reflected in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn November 3, 2021, Aurora completed its planned special purpose acquisition company (\u201cSPAC\u201d) merger with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, resulting in\nAurora becoming a publicly traded company post combination. Upon the completion of the merger, all of our Aurora Investments converted into shares of the\nnewly issued Class A common stock of the publicly traded company. In addition, our ownership was significantly diluted and we lost the ability to appoint a second\nseat on Aurora\u2019s board of directors. As a result, we no longer held significant influence over Aurora. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our Aurora Investment has\nbeen classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at\nfair value on a recurring basis. We recognized an unrealized gain of $1.6 billion and unrealized loss of $3.0 billion on this investment in other income (expense),\nnet in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n97Summarized financial information for Aurora for the year ended December 31, 2021 is as follows (in millions):\nResults of Operations DataYear Ended\nDecember  31, 2021\nRevenue $ 83 \nTotal operating expenses 813 \nLoss from operations (731)\nNet loss (755)\nBalance Sheet DataAs of\nDecember  31, 2021\nCurrent assets $ 1,677 \nTotal assets 3,690 \nCurrent liabilities 91 \nTotal liabilities 348 \nGrab Investment\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we determined the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities in Grab had declined below their amortized cost based on\nan analysis of the observed valuation declines of Grab\u2019s publicly-traded competitive peer group and representative stock market indices. These observed inputs\nwere considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that was\napplied to the valuation derived from Grab\u2019s latest financing transaction which occurred earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and prior to the announcement of\nCOVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for Mobility services. As a result, the carrying value of the investment in Grab was reduced by\n$230 million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million,\nrepresenting the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance\nsheet and a corresponding credit-related impairment charge recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. Due to the\nsignificant uncertainty about Grab\u2019s ability to repay the redemption amount of the securities on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected was\nconsidered to be less than the fair value of the securities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost was\nconsidered to reflect a credit-related impairment charge.\nThe fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing transaction closed by the\ninvestee during that quarter. As a result, we recognized a reversal of the previously recorded allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance sheet and a\ncorresponding reversal of the credit-related impairment charge to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn December 1, 2021, Grab completed its planned SPAC merger with Altimeter Growth Corporation, resulting in Grab becoming a publicly traded company\npost combination. Upon the completion of the merger, our investment in Series G preferred shares of Grab, which was previously accounted for as an investment in\nan available-for-sale debt security due to the redemption feature of the shares, converted into the newly issued Class A ordinary shares of the publicly traded\ncompany. We recorded the fair value of our investment with changes in the fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax through the date of\nthe conversion. Upon the conversion, we released the accumulative pre-tax unrealized gains on the investment of $2.8 billion recorded through other\ncomprehensive income and recognized them as unrealized gains in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations for year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. Subsequent to the conversion, we recognized unrealized losses of $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion on the investment in other income (expense),\nnet in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, for the fair value change of the equity security.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Grab investment has been classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table\npresenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nLime Investments\nOur ownership in Lime is comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note\n(collectively, the \u201c2020 Lime Investments\u201d). The 2020 Lime Investments were received as part of the transaction by which we divested of our JUMP business.\nRefer to Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures for further information regarding the JUMP Divestiture and the 2020 Lime Investments. Our investment in Lime Common Stock\nand representation on Lime\u2019s board of directors gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over Lime. We elected to apply the fair value option to our\nLime Common Stock investment and therefore we are applying fair value accounting to all of the 2020 Lime Investments which provides for consistency of\naccounting treatment. The 2020 Lime Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. In December\n2021, we contributed an additional $50 million of cash to Lime in exchange for a second convertible secured note that may be converted into common or preferred\nstock. The fair value of the 2020 Lime Investments as of December 31, 2021 of\n98$162 million was determined by referencing a financing transaction and used as an input to an OPM. Other key inputs to the OPM were discount rates of 22% and\n28%, volatility of 70% and time to liquidity of 1.25 years.\nThe fair value of our Lime investments as of December 31, 2022 of $113 million was determined by referencing a financing transaction and used as an input to\nan OPM. Other key inputs to the OPM were discount rates of 32% and 38%, volatility of 87% and time to liquidity of 1.50 years.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31,\n2021 and 2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nNon-marketable\nDebt SecuritiesNon-marketable\nEquity Securities Notes Receivable MLU B.V.

As a\nresult, our investments have been classified as marketable equity securities with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information, see the section titled \u201cAurora Investment\u201d and \u201cGrab Investment\u201d above.\nWe did not make any transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nNon-Financial Assets\nOur non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized.\nSuch fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of our non-\nmarketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the\nmeasurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of\noperations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these securities based on\nvaluation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for contractual rights and\nobligations of the securities we hold.\nThe following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses from remeasurement (referred to as upward or downward adjustments) recorded in other income\n(expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held during the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 based on the observable price in\n99an orderly transaction for the same or similar security of the same issuers (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nUpward adjustments $ \u2014 $ 71 $ 1,046 \nDownward adjustments (including impairment) (1,690) \u2014 (641)\nTotal unrealized gain (loss) for non-marketable equity securities $ (1,690)$ 71 $ 405 \nWe evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential\nimpairment indicators. This evaluation consists of several factors including, but not limited to, an assessment of a significant adverse change in the economic\nenvironment, significant adverse changes in the general market condition of the geographies and industries in which our investees operate, and other publicly\navailable information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from\nCOVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, was\nless than their carrying value.\nDidi Investment\nTo determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,\nweighted at 80% and 20%, respectively. The following table summarizes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation for our\ninvestment in Didi as of March 31, 2020:\nFair value method Key unobservable input\nCSE Market adjustment (20)%\nOPM Volatility 39%\nEstimated time to liquidity 2.0 years\nMarket adjustment (40)%\nAs a result of the valuation performed, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of\noperations during the first quarter of 2020. There was no remeasurement event for our investment in Didi that occurred during the remainder of 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of $500 million of our Didi shares and realized immaterial gains from this transaction. In addition, we\nrecorded unrealized gains of $71 million from remeasurement of the carrying value of the remaining Didi shares under the measurement alternative during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2021.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, Didi completed their delisting from the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE Delisting\u201d). We concluded the ordinary shares held\nby us did not have a readily determinable fair value and should be accounted for under the measurement alternative method. As of December 31, 2022, Didi\nAmerican Depositary Shares (\u201cADS\u201d) continue to be traded in the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) market. We determined that the Didi ADS were similar to the ordinary\nshares held prior to the NYSE Delisting. We then measured the investment to fair value based on the closing share price of the Didi ADS on the OTC market on\nDecember 31, 2022 as an observable transaction for similar securities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an unrealized loss of $1.0 billion on\nthis investment in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.\nWe did not record any realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the total carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis held, including\ncumulative unrealized upward and downward adjustments made to the initial cost basis of the securities (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2021 2022\nInitial cost basis $ 279 $ 1,700 \nUpward adjustments 4 1,052 \nDownward adjustments (including impairment) \u2014 (641)\nTotal carrying value at the end of the period $ 283 $ 2,111 \n100Note 4 - Equity Method Investments\nThe carrying value of our equity method investments were as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2021 2022\nMLU B.V. $ 751 $ 816 \nMission Bay 3 & 4 38 34 \nOther 11 20 \nEquity method investments $ 800 $ 870 \nMLU B.V. Investment\nDuring 2018, we closed a transaction that contributed the net assets of our Uber Russia/CIS operations into a newly formed private limited liability company\n(\u201cMLU B.V.\u201d or \u201cYandex.Taxi joint venture\u201d), with Yandex and us holding ownership interests in MLU B.V. In exchange for consideration contributed, we\nreceived a seat on MLU B.V.\u2019s board and an initial 38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V. The investment was determined to be\nan equity method investment due to our ability to exercise significant influence over MLU B.V. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our equity ownership interest\nin MLU B.V. was 29% on a fully-diluted basis.\nWe review for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be recoverable. During the first quarter\nof 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other income\n(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the Russian\neconomy as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencing revenue\nmultiples from publicly traded peer companies.\n2021\nOn August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the \u201cFramework Agreement\u201d) to restructure our joint ventures, MLU B.V. and Yandex Self\nDriving Group B.V. (\u201cSDG\u201d) and we would sell to Yandex (i) our 4.5% equity interest in MLU B.V. and (ii) our entire equity interest in SDG (the \u201cInitial\nClosing\u201d). Subsequent to the Initial Closing, Yandex spun-off, by way of demerger from MLU B.V., its delivery businesses: Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and\nYandex.Delivery (collectively, \u201cDemerged Businesses\u201d). Immediately following the demerger, Yandex acquired all of our equity interest in the Demerged\nBusinesses (\u201cDemerger Share Closing\u201d). In connection with the Framework Agreement, we granted Yandex an option (\u201cMLU B.V. Call Option\u201d) to acquire our\nremaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during the two-year period following the Initial Closing. The total consideration paid by Yandex to us for the transaction\nwas $1.0 billion in cash allocated as follows: (i) $276 million for our 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V.; (ii) $412 million for our equity interest in the Demerged\nBusinesses; (iii) $230 million for the MLU B.V. Call Option; and (iv) the remaining immaterial amounts to our interest in SDG.\nInitial Closing\nDuring the third quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, we completed the sale of our entire equity interest in SDG and 4.5% of equity\ninterest in MLU B.V. to Yandex. At the initial closing, we derecognized 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V. and recognized a gain of $106 million in other income\n(expense), net on our consolidated statement of operations. The consideration allocated and gains recognized for the sale of our entire equity interest in SDG were\nnot material.\nDemerger Share Closing\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, MLU B.V. completed the spin-off of the Demerger Businesses and Yandex\nacquired all of our equity interest in the Demerged Businesses. As a result, we derecognized our entire equity interest in the Demerged Businesses and recognized a\ngain of $242 million in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.\nMLU B.V. Basis Difference\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate share\nof the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V. on a\none-quarter lag basis and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for\ncurrency translation adjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee and the U.S. Dollar.\n101The table below provides the composition of the basis difference (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2022\nEquity method goodwill $ 320 \nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization 31 \nDeferred tax liabilities (8)\nCumulative currency translation adjustments 7 \nBasis difference $ 350 \nWe amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-\nline method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 3.3 years and 3.0 years as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Equity\nmethod goodwill is not amortized.\nMLU B.V. Call Option\nThe MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, initially valued at $230 million\nand measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. As\nof December 31, 2022, the exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.9 billion, subject to certain adjustments based on the timing of the\noption exercise.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option was $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value\nchange during the year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model\nwhich simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model\nwere underlying business value, option term of 1.7 years, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).\nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option was $2 million. We recorded a $191 million net gain for the fair value change during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2022, we used a lattice model which simulated\nmultiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the\nunderlying business value; option term of 0.7 years; volatility of 65%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).\nMission Bay 3 & 4\nThe Mission Bay 3 & 4 JV refers to Event Center Office Partners, LLC (\u201cECOP\u201d), a joint venture entity established in 2018, by Uber and two companies\n(\u201cLLC Partners\u201d) to manage the construction and operation of two office buildings owned by two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries. We contributed $136 million\ncash in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and 10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% as\nof December 31, 2021 and 2022.\nIn March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were used to first pay off the\nexisting construction loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and last, the remaining proceeds were distributed back to\nUber and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage. As a result, Uber received $91 million from the ECOP as a return of capital investment, and\nreduced the investment carrying value by the same amount.\nWe have significant influence over ECOP and we account for our investment in ECOP under the equity method. At each reporting period and a quarter in\narrears, we adjust the carrying value of our investment to reflect our proportionate share of ECOP\u2019s income or loss, and any impairments, with a corresponding\ncredit or debit, respectively, to income or loss from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. During 2019, the construction\nwas completed and leasing activities commenced, During 2020, 2021 and 2022 an immaterial amounts of equity earnings were recognized. During 2021 and 2022,\nwe incurred immaterial amounts of lease payments with ECOP, which is a related party. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we determined that there were no\nimpairments of our investment in ECOP.\nNote 5 \u2013 Property and Equipment, Net\n102The components of property and equipment, net were as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2021 2022\nLand $ 65 $ 65 \nBuilding and site improvements 737 739 \nLeasehold improvements 594 609 \nComputer equipment 468 529 \nLeased computer equipment 650 712 \nLeased vehicles 7 11 \nInternal-use software 258 389 \nFurniture and fixtures 99 94 \nConstruction in progress 157 219 \nTotal 3,035 3,367 \nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,182) (1,285)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 1,853 $ 2,082 \nAmounts in construction in progress represent buildings, leasehold improvements, assets under construction, and other assets not placed in service.\nDepreciation expense relating to property and equipment was $364 million, $393 million, and $346 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and\n2022, respectively. Included in these amounts were depreciation expense for leased computer equipment in the amount of $198 million, $217 million, and $186\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Accumulated depreciation and amortization included $390 million and $305 million\nof leased computer equipment depreciation as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nAmortization of capitalized software development costs was not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nNote 6 - Leases    \nOur leases primarily include corporate offices, data centers, and servers. The lease term of operating and finance leases vary from less than a year to 76 years.\nWe have leases that include one or more options to extend the lease term for up to 14 years as well as options to terminate the lease within one year. Our lease\nterms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. Our lease agreements generally do not\ncontain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nThe components of our lease expense were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nLease cost\nFinance lease cost:\n      Amortization of assets $ 199 $ 217 $ 186 \n      Interest of lease liabilities 16 12 13 \nOperating lease cost 482 299 304 \nShort-term lease cost 17 7 7 \nVariable lease cost 109 96 142 \nSublease income (2) (5) (17)\nTotal lease cost $ 821 $ 626 $ 635  (1)\n103 We exited certain leased offices, primarily due to the City of San Francisco\u2019s extended shelter-in-place orders and our restructuring activities, resulting in\naccelerated lease cost of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nOther information\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from financing leases $ 14 $ 11 $ 13 \nOperating cash flows from operating leases 250 297 339 \nFinancing cash flows from financing leases 224 226 184 \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:\nOperating lease liabilities $ 202 $ 273 $ 329 \nFinance lease liabilities 196 184 349 \nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows (in millions, except lease term and discount rate):\nAs of December 31,\n2021 2022\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 1,388 $ 1,449 \nOperating lease liability, current $ 185 $ 201 \nOperating lease liabilities, non-current 1,644 1,673 \n     Total operating lease liabilities $ 1,829 $ 1,874 \nAs of December 31,\n2021 2022\nFinance Leases\nProperty and equipment, at cost $ 650 $ 712 \nAccumulated depreciation (390) (305)\n     Property and equipment, net $ 260 $ 407 \nOther current liabilities $ 191 $ 115 \nOther long-term liabilities 43 284 \n     Total finance leases liabilities $ 234 $ 399 \nAs of December 31,\n2021 2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term\n     Operating leases 15 years 15 years\n     Finance leases 2 years 3 years\nWeighted-average discount rate\n     Operating leases 6.7 % 6.6 %\n     Finance leases 4.2 % 5.7 %(1)\n104Maturities of lease liabilities were as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2022\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2023 $ 266 $ 135 \n2024 314 134 \n2025 262 105 \n2026 228 68 \n2027 215 \u2014 \nThereafter 2,073 \u2014 \nTotal undiscounted lease payments 3,358 442 \nLess: imputed interest (1,484) (43)\nTotal lease liabilities $ 1,874 $ 399 \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had additional operating leases, primarily for corporate offices, that have not yet commenced of $193 million. These operating\nleases will commence in fiscal year 2023 with lease terms of 5 years to 10 years.\nMission Bay 1 & 2\nIn 2015, we entered into a joint venture (\u201cJV\u201d) agreement with a real estate developer (\u201cJV Partner\u201d) to develop land (\u201cthe Land\u201d) in San Francisco to\nconstruct our new headquarters (the \u201cHeadquarters\u201d). The Headquarters consists of two adjacent office buildings totaling approximately 423,000 rentable square\nfeet. In connection with the JV arrangement, we acquired a 49% interest in the JV, the principal asset of which was the Land.\nIn 2016, we and the JV Partner agreed to dissolve the JV and terminate our commitment to the lease of the Headquarters (together \u201cthe real estate transaction\u201d)\nand we retained a 49% indirect interest in the Land (\u201cIndirect Interest\u201d). Under the terms of the real estate transaction, we obtained the rights and title to the\npartially constructed building, completed the development of the two office buildings and retained a 100% ownership in the buildings. In connection with the real\nestate transaction, we also executed two 75-year land lease agreements (\u201cLand Leases\u201d). As of December 31, 2022, commitments under the Land Leases total $128\nmillion until February 2032. After 2032, the annual rent amount will adjust annually based on the prevailing consumer price index.\nThe real estate transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction of our 49% Indirect Interest due to our continuing involvement through a purchase option\non the Indirect Interest.

The $2.6 billion is comprised of (i) a $1.1 billion tranche with a maturity date of February 25, 2027, replacing the\n2016 Senior Secured Term Loan as a Refinancing Term Loan (the \u201c2027 Refinanced Term Loan\u201d), and (ii) a $1.5 billion tranche with a maturity date of April 4,\n2025, replacing the 2018 Senior Secured Term Loan as an Incremental Term Loan (the \u201c2025 Refinanced Term Loan\u201d). The interest rate for the 2027 Refinanced\nTerm Loan and the 2025 Refinanced Term Loan is the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 3.50% per annum, subject to a floor of 0.00%. The\nrefinancing transaction qualified as a debt modification that did not result in an extinguishment.\nThe 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and the 2027 Refinanced Term Loan are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The 2025\nRefinanced Term Loan and the 2027 Refinanced Term Loan agreements contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur\ndebt, incur liens and undergo certain fundamental changes. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2022. The loan is secured by certain of\nour intellectual property and equity of certain material foreign subsidiaries.\nThe fair values of our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022\nand were determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\n2025 Convertible Notes\nIn December 2020, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2025 (the \u201c2025 Convertible Notes\u201d), including\nthe exercise in full by the initial purchasers of the 2025 Convertible Notes of their option to purchase(1)\n(1)\n107up to an additional $150 million principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement to qualified\ninstitutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2025, unless earlier converted,\nredeemed or repurchased.\nHolders of the 2025 Convertible Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately\npreceding September 15, 2025 only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31,\n2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a\nperiod of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130%\nof the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement\nperiod\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined below) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of\nthe product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) if we call such notes for redemption, at any\ntime prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the applicable redemption date; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified\ncorporate events. On or after September 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders\nmay convert all or any portion of their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\nAs of December 31, 2022, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore,\nthe 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.\nThe initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately\n$80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special\ninterest.\nUpon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and\nshares of our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at\nour option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at\nleast 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and\nincluding, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount\nof the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nThe indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the\nincurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded\nas equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability\ncomponent (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity\ncomponent of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not\nremeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as\nof the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.\nEffective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to\nadditional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the\nopening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible\nNotes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.\nThe fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $973 million as of December 31, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\nSenior Notes\nIn October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Senior Notes\u201d) and eight-\nyear notes with aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on November 1, 2026 (the \u201c2026 Senior Notes\u201d) in a private placement offering totaling $2.0 billion.\nWe issued the 2023 and 2026 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $9 million for debt issuance costs. The interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and\nNovember 1 of each year at 7.5% per annum and 8.0% per annum, respectively, beginning on May 1, 2019, and the entire principal amount is due at the time of\nmaturity.\nIn September 2019, we issued eight-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $1.2 billion due on September 15, 2027 (the \u201c2027 Senior Notes\u201d) in a\nprivate placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act.

We issued the 2025 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $8\nmillion for debt issuance costs.

We issued the 2028 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately\n$5 million for debt issuance costs. The interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year at 6.25% per annum, beginning on\nJuly 15, 2021, and the entire principal amount is due at the time of maturity. In October 2020, we used the net proceeds from this offering, along with cash on hand,\nto redeem all of our outstanding 2023 Senior Notes. The redemption of the 2023 Senior Notes was for substantially identical 2028 Senior Notes. Following the\nredemption, there were no 2023 Senior Notes outstanding.\nIn August 2021, we issued eight-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on August 15, 2029 (the \u201c2029 Senior Notes\u201d) in a private\nplacement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

The interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year at 4.50% per annum, beginning on\nFebruary 15, 2022, and the entire principal amount is due at the time of maturity and therefore, the 2029 Senior Notes are classified as long-term.

On April 4, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) provide for\napproximately $2.2 billion of revolving credit commitments, (ii) extend the maturity date for the commitments and loans from June 13, 2023 to April 4, 2027, (iii)\nreduce the minimum liquidity covenant from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion, (iv) replace the LIBOR based interest rate with a Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) based interest rate, and (v) make certain other changes to the negative covenants under the amended revolving credit agreement.

Following our IPO in May 2019, we have only issued awards\nunder the 2019 Plan and the ESPP, and no additional awards will be granted under the 2010 and 2013 Plans. These plans provide for the issuance of incentive stock\noptions (\u201cISOs\u201d), nonqualified stock options (\u201cNSOs\u201d), SARs, restricted stock, RSUs, performance-based awards, and other awards (that are based in whole or in\npart by reference to our common stock).\nThe number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan automatically increases on January 1 of each year, for a period of not\nmore than ten years, commencing on January 1, 2020 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2029 by the lesser of (a) 5% of the total number of the shares of\ncommon stock outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, and (b) such number of shares determined by our board of directors.\nPursuant to the automatic increase feature of the 2019 Plan, our board of directors approved an increase of 100 million shares reserved for issuance effective\nJanuary 1, 2023, for a total of 403 million shares reserved.\nStock Option and SAR Activity\nA summary of stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in\nthousands, per share amounts, and years):\nSARs Outstanding\nNumber of SARsOptions\nOutstanding\nNumber of SharesWeighted-Average\nExercise Price Per\nShareWeighted-Average\nRemaining\nContractual Life\n(in years)Aggregate Intrinsic\nValue\nAs of December 31, 2021 157 24,253 $ 11.84 4.35$ 735 \nGranted 6 421 $ 33.78 \nExercised (3) (4,072)$ 4.32 \nCanceled and forfeited (7) (563)$ 8.72 \nAs of December 31, 2022 153 20,039 $ 13.90 3.47$ 279 \nVested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2022 146 15,064 $ 9.61 2.99$ 251 \nExercisable as of December 31, 2022 146 15,064 $ 9.61 2.99$ 251 \nThe total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, was $614 million, $382 million and\n$101 million, respectively.\nRSU Activity\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nNumber of SharesWeighted-Average\n Grant-Date Fair\n Value per Share\nUnvested and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 71,461 $ 41.91 \nGranted 90,769 $ 31.05 \nVested (47,989)$ 37.34 \nCanceled and forfeited (16,074)$ 38.11 \nUnvested and outstanding as of December 31, 2022 98,167 $ 34.70 \nThe total fair value of RSUs vested for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 was $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.8 billion, respectively.\nRestricted Common Stock\nWe have granted restricted common stock to certain continuing employees, primarily in connection with acquisitions. Vesting of this stock may be dependent\non a combination of service and performance conditions that become satisfied upon the occurrence of a qualifying event. We have the right to repurchase shares for\nwhich the vesting conditions are not satisfied. During 2022, there were no restricted common stock granted, canceled, or forfeited, and the amount of unvested\nrestricted common stock as of December 31, 2022 was 2.6 million shares, with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $43.50 per share.\n113Stock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense is allocated based on the cost center to which the award holder belongs. The following table summarizes total stock-based\ncompensation expense by function for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nOperations and support $ 72 $ 139 $ 154 \nSales and marketing 48 83 102 \nResearch and development 477 614 1,060 \nGeneral and administrative 230 332 477 \nTotal $ 827 $ 1,168 $ 1,793 \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we modified the terms of stock-based awards for certain employees upon their termination or\nchange in employment status. Incremental stock-based compensation cost in relation to the modification of stock-based awards was not material for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $3.4 billion of unamortized compensation costs related to all unvested awards. The unamortized compensation costs are\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.57 years. Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as internally developed\nsoftware costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nThe tax benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nDuring 2020, 2021 and 2022, warrants vested to non-employee service providers and others were not material and no warrants were granted.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options and SARs granted to employees in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were\n$35.77, $39.43 and $13.58 per share, respectively. During 2022, stock options and SARs granted were not material. The fair value of stock options and SARs\ngranted was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the weighted-average assumptions in the table below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021\nExpected term (in years) 4.0 5.1\nRisk-free interest rate 0.3 % 0.9 %\nExpected volatility 42.5 % 40.3 %\nExpected dividend yield \u2014 % \u2014 %\nPerformance awards with market-based targets granted in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were not material.\n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe number of shares of Uber common stock available for issuance under the ESPP automatically increases on January 1 of each year, beginning in 2020 and\ncontinuing through 2029, by the lesser of (a) 1.0% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding\ncalendar year, and (b) 25,000,000 shares. However, our board of directors or compensation committee may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year.\nPursuant to the automatic increase feature of the ESPP, effective January 1, 2023, a total of 86 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the\nESPP.\nThe stock-based compensation expense recognized for the ESPP was not material during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022. During the year\nended December 31, 2022, we purchased 5 million shares of common stock under the ESPP at a weighted-average price of $20.22 per share. As of December 31,\n2022, total unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP was $25 million, which will be amortized over a period of 0.13 years.\n114Note 11 \u2013 Income Taxes\nThe U.S. and foreign components of income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 are\nas follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nU.S. $ (3,518)$ (340)$ (8,523)\nForeign (3,428) (685) (903)\nLoss before income taxes and income (loss) from equity method investments $ (6,946)$ (1,025)$ (9,426)\nThe components of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 are as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nCurrent\nFederal $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 8 \nState 11 4 15 \nForeign 63 196 237 \nTotal current tax expense 74 200 260 \nDeferred\nFederal (97) (76) (251)\nState (7) 19 (92)\nForeign (162) (635) (98)\nTotal deferred tax expense (benefit) (266) (692) (441)\nTotal provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ (192)$ (492)$ (181)\nThe following is a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nFederal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income tax expense (0.1) (2.3) 0.8 \nForeign rate differential 10.8 10.3 2.0 \nNon-deductible expenses (1.3) (5.2) (0.7)\nStock-based compensation 1.3 4.5 (1.4)\nFederal research and development credits 2.9 7.8 0.6 \nDeferred tax on investments 0.9 48.7 (1.1)\nEntity restructuring (1.7) (2.0) (12.7)\nChange in unrecognized tax benefits (3.7) (27.8) (8.9)\nValuation allowance (45.8) (33.7) 1.1 \nUS tax on foreign income \u2014 (10.8) 0.6 \nTax rate change 14.4 22.4 \u2014 \nOther interest 3.2 16.8 1.7 \nOther, net 0.9 (1.7) (1.1)\nEffective income tax rate 2.8 % 48.0 % 1.9 %\n The 2020 rate impact for \u201cDeferred tax on investments\u201d was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact and the deferred China tax impact of the\nimpairment charge related to our investment in Didi.\nThe 2021 rate impact for \u201cDeferred tax on investments\u201d was primarily driven by the deferred China and U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Didi\nand the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, and Zomato.(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n115The 2022 rate impact for \u201cDeferred tax on investments\u201d was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Grab,\nZomato, and Didi.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we transferred certain intangible assets among our wholly-owned subsidiaries to align our structure to our evolving\noperations. The transaction resulted in the establishment of deferred tax assets of $354 million; however, there was no financial statement benefit\nrecognized since the deferred tax asset was offset by a full valuation allowance.\nTo align our structure to our evolving operations, in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible\nassets. These intercompany transfers did not have a material impact to the financial statements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we transferred certain intangible assets among our wholly-owned subsidiaries to align our structure to our evolving\noperations. The transfer resulted in a net reduction in deferred tax assets of $1.7 billion; however, there was no financial statement expense recognized\nsince the deferred tax asset was offset by a full valuation allowance.\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2021 2022\nDeferred tax assets\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 5,992 $ 6,325 \nResearch and development credits 1,020 1,200 \nStock-based compensation 66 45 \nAccruals and reserves 290 402 \nAccrued legal 119 184 \nFixed assets and intangible assets 6,753 4,425 \nLease liability 455 478 \nInterest limitation carryforwards 629 858 \nCapitalized research expenses \u2014 304 \nOther 107 320 \nTotal deferred tax assets 15,431 14,541 \nLess: Valuation allowance (13,920) (13,971)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 1,511 570 \nDeferred tax liabilities\nIndefinite lived deferred tax liability 1,451 \u2014 \nROU assets 334 354 \nOther 29 77 \nTotal deferred tax liabilities 1,814 431 \nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ (303)$ 139 \n As of December 31, 2021, the $1.5 billion indefinite-lived deferred tax liability represents the deferred U.S. income tax expense, which will be incurred\nupon the eventual disposition of the shares underlying our investments in Didi, Aurora, Grab, and Zomato.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair market value of our investments in Didi, Aurora, Grab, and Zomato decreased significantly, resulting in the reduction of\nindefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities.\nBased on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions\u2019 deferred\ntax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred\ntax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary\ndifferences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market\nconditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax\nassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferred\ntax assets of $13.9 billion and $14.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. In 2022, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily\nattributable to an increase in deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, offset by the deferred tax impact from the transfer of certain intangible\nassets among our wholly-owned subsidiaries.(2) \n(1)\n(1)\n116The indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") means that indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities can be considered as support for\nrealization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2021, we\nrealized approximately $1.2 billion of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities being used as a source\nof income. As of December 31, 2022, we realized an immaterial amount of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferred\ntax liabilities being used as a source of income.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $1.9 billion that begin to expire in 2031 and $12.1 billion that have an unlimited\ncarryover period. As of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of $9.4 billion that started expiring in 2022 and $2.0 billion that have an\nunlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2022, we had foreign NOL carryforwards of $633 million that begin to expire in 2023 and $17.7 billion that have\nan unlimited carryover period.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards of $843 million that begin to expire in 2028. We had U.S. state research tax\ncredit carryforwards of $6 million that begin to expire in 2032 and $609 million that have an unlimited carryover period.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operating\nlosses, tax credits and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through December 31, 2022.\nBased on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nThe following table reflects changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 1,797 $ 2,293 $ 2,657 \nGross increases - current year tax positions 353 239 814 \nGross increases - prior year tax positions 191 134 93 \nGross decreases - prior year tax positions (48) (9) (51)\nGross decreases - settlements with tax authorities \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 2,293 $ 2,657 $ 3,513 \nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately $198 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining $3.3\nbillion of the unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of\noperations. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 was $18 million and $21 million, respectively.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits\ncould significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are\nunable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of\nDecember 31, 2022 that are reasonably possible to occur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under various state and other foreign income tax examinations.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute\nwas generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the open tax years for our major tax jurisdictions are as follows:\nJurisdiction Tax Years\nU.S. Federal 2011 - 2022\nU.S. States 2005 - 2022\nBrazil 2017 - 2022\nNetherlands 2019 - 2022\nUnited Kingdom 2013 - 2022\nAs of December 31, 2022, the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to\nindefinitely reinvest is not material.\n117Note 12 \u2013 Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net\nloss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible\nsecurities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using\nthe equity method.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (in millions, except share amounts\nwhich are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nBasic net loss per share:\nNumerator\nNet loss including non-controlling interests $ (6,788)$ (570)$ (9,138)\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax (20) (74) 3 \nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (6,768)$ (496)$ (9,141)\nDenominator\nBasic weighted-average common stock outstanding 1,752,960 1,892,546 1,972,131 \nBasic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders $ (3.86)$ (0.26)$ (4.64)\nDiluted net loss per share:\nNumerator\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (6,768)$ (496)$ (9,141)\nNet loss attributable to Freight Holding convertible common shares non-controlling interest, net\nof tax \u2014 (44) (41)\nDiluted net loss attributable to common stockholders $ (6,768)$ (540)$ (9,182)\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic net loss per share computation 1,752,960 1,892,546 1,972,131 \nWeighted-average effect of potentially dilutive securities:\nAssumed redemption of Freight Holding convertible common shares, non-controlling interest \u2014 2,973 2,797 \nDiluted weighted-average common stock outstanding 1,752,960 1,895,519 1,974,928 \nDiluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders $ (3.86)$ (0.29)$ (4.65)\nPer share amounts are calculated using unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate.\nEffective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, we use the if-converted method and\npresume share settlement for our 2025 Convertible Notes and our non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the acquisition of Careem (\u201cCareem\nNotes\u201d) when calculating the dilutive effect of these notes.\nThe following potentially dilutive outstanding securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been\nanti-dilutive for the periods presented, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of(1)\n(1)\n(1) \n118certain conditions which were not satisfied by the end of the period (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nFreight Holding contingently redeemable preferred stock 14,339 10,070 30,458 \nConvertible notes 28,407 21,740 18,250 \nRSUs 83,736 71,461 98,167 \nStock options 28,734 24,253 20,039 \nCommon stock subject to repurchase 28 4,153 2,606 \nRSUs to settle fixed monetary awards 49 \u2014 \u2014 \nShares committed under ESPP 2,451 3,226 3,878 \nWarrants to purchase common stock 126 73 73 \nTotal 157,870 134,976 173,471 \nNote 13 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Information\nWe determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating\ndecisions and evaluates operating performance.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we changed the name of the Rides segment to Mobility and the name of the Eats segment to Delivery. In addition, during\nthe second quarter of 2020, we completed the divestiture of our JUMP business (the \u201cJUMP Divestiture\u201d), which comprised substantially all of the operations of\nour Other Bets reportable segment. Subsequent to the JUMP Divestiture, the Other Bets segment no longer exists and the continuing activities previously included\nin the Other Bets segment are immaterial for all periods presented. Certain of these other continuing business activities were migrated to our Mobility segment,\nwhose prior period results were not restated because such business activities were immaterial. The other business activities that were not migrated represent an \u201call\nother category separate from other reconciling items\u201d and are presented within the All Other caption. The historical results of the former Other Bets segment are\nincluded within the All Other caption. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures for further information regarding the JUMP Divestiture.\nIn January 2021, we sold our ATG Business to Aurora. Our ATG Business was included in the ATG and Other Technology Programs segment prior to this\ntransaction. As a result of the sale, ATG and Other Technology Programs segment was no longer a reportable segment. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021,\nresults of ATG and Other Technology Programs are included within All Other. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures for further information regarding the sale of our ATG\nBusiness.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\nSegmentDescription\nMobility Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,\nmotorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or\nhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as\nwell as select other goods.\nFreight Freight connects Carriers with Shipper\u2019s shipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the\nability to book a shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region refer to Note 2 \u2013\nRevenue.\n119Our segment operating performance measure is segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and,\naccordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue,\noperations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table\nbelow).\nThe following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation of total segment Adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA:\nMobility $ 1,169 $ 1,596 $ 3,299 \nDelivery (873) (348) 551 \nFreight (227) (130) \u2014 \nAll Other (461) (11) \u2014 \nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA (392) 1,107 3,850 \nReconciling items:\nCorporate G&A and Platform R&D (2,136) (1,881) (2,137)\nDepreciation and amortization (575) (902) (947)\nStock-based compensation expense (827) (1,168) (1,793)\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements 35 (526) (732)\nGoodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets (317) (157) (25)\nAcquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses (86) (102) (46)\nAccelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets (102) (5) (6)\nCOVID-19 response initiatives (106) (54) (1)\nGain (loss) on lease arrangement, net 5 \u2014 (7)\nRestructuring and related charges, net (362) \u2014 (2)\nLegacy auto insurance transfer \u2014 (103) \u2014 \nMass arbitration fees, net \u2014 (43) 14 \nLoss from operations $ (4,863)$ (3,834)$ (1,832)\nIncludes historical results of ATG and Other Technology Programs and New Mobility.\n Excluding stock-based compensation expense.\n Includes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments.

Platform R&D also includes mapping and payment technologies and support and development of the\ninternal technology infrastructure. Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change.\n Refer to Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nGeographic Information\nRevenue by geography is based on where the trip or shipment was completed or meal delivered. Long-lived assets, net includes property and equipment, net\nand operating lease right-of-use assets as well as the same asset class included within assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. The following tables\nset forth revenue and long-lived assets, net by geographic area as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nUnited States $ 6,082 $ 9,058 $ 17,953 \nUnited Kingdom 637 551 4,215 \nAll other countries 4,420 7,846 9,709 \nTotal Revenue $ 11,139 $ 17,455 $ 31,877 (1)\n(2), (3)\n(4)\n(1) \n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(1)\n120In 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of Mobility and Delivery services\nto end-users in those markets. In these markets, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users,\nwhile payments to Drivers in exchange for Mobility and Delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Refer to\nNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nAs of December 31,\n2021 2022\nUnited States $ 2,991 $ 3,210 \nAll other countries 250 321 \nTotal long-lived assets, net $ 3,241 $ 3,531 \nRevenue grouped by offerings and geographical region is included in Note 2 \u2013 Revenue.\nNote 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various claims, non-income tax audits and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022,\nwe had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $0.6 billion relate to non-income tax matters in accrued\nand other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably\nestimable.\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent\ncontractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair\ncompetition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d)\nclaims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.\nWe have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit\nproceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California\nState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of\nmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters\nwere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially\nadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\n\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers\nperforming services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s\ncontrol, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of\nbusiness performed for the hiring entity.\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in\nSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages\nrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed a\npetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November\n2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of\nthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to\ncomply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.(1) \n121The California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court following the appellate\nproceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction with\nthe trial court. On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the stipulation. Although the preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit\nremains ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. We have petitioned to stay this matter\npending coordination with other California employment related matters, which was granted and a coordination judge was assigned. Since the assignment of the\ncoordination judge, the case has been stayed pending appeal of the denial of a motion to compel arbitration. We intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves.\nOur chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\nIn addition, in January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is\nunconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the\nAlameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with\nthe California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument\nwas heard on December 13, 2022 and we await a decision.\nMassachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Drivers\nare employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion in\nwhich we argue that the motion is premature. The court granted our motion to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022 and summary judgment\npapers will be fully briefed by August 29, 2023. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be\nestimated.\nNew York Attorney General\nThe New York Attorney General has alleged misclassification of drivers and related employment violations in New York by Uber as well as fraud related to\ncertain deductions. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022.\nSwiss Social Security Rulings\nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of Uber\nB.V. for social security or labor purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.\nIn April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and\nRasier Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2021. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App\nin 2014 as dependent workers of Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal\nTribunal and has no impact on our current operations. On June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by which both Drivers and Couriers in the Canton\nof Geneva are classified as employees of Uber BV, Uber Portier B.V. and Uber Switzerland GmbH.\nFollowing this ruling, we received a request for information from the SVA Z\u00fcrich that states that couriers shall be considered employees for social security\npurposes since the launch of Uber Eats. The ultimate resolution of the matters before the social security authorities is uncertain and the amount accrued for those\nmatters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022.\nAslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\nOn October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that\nthey should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The\ntribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of\nthe App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at\nthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law\npurposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving\nwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically\n122enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their\nclassification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22,\n2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who\naccepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on\nthe correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the\nenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan. While the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, we have recorded an accrual for these\nmatters within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022.\nSpain Labor Audits\nLabor authorities in Spain opened audits reviewing the classification status of Couriers (in particular with regards to social security contributions). We have\nreceived assessments as of December 31, 2022. We will proceed (or have proceeded) to appeal to the Court of First Instance for each of them. There are ongoing\naudits for which we have not yet received an assessment. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss\ncannot be estimated for these ongoing audits.\nOther Driver Classification Matters\nAdditionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,\nadministrative actions, and government investigations and audits challenging our classification of Drivers as independent contractors and not employees. We\nbelieve that our current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nHowever, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could\nhave a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these\nmatters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other\nfactors.\nState Unemployment Taxes\nNew Jersey Department of Labor\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (\u201cNJDOL\u201d) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes\nof determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both\nRasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from\n2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised\namount of the assessment and have since reached agreement on and paid the remaining amounts allegedly owed from 2014 through 2018.\nThe NJDOL has expressed its intention to audit later years. The ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is\nrecorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022.\nCalifornia Employment Development Department\nIn 2014, the California employment development department (\u201cCA EDD\u201d) opened an audit to review whether drivers should be treated as employees or\nindependent contractors. The department issued an assessment in 2016 for the periods of 2013 - 2015 and we have since reached an agreement with the CA EDD\nfor this period. In 2022, we have received requests for information related to an audit of a subsequent period, which covers the fourth quarter of 2017 through the\nfourth quarter of 2020. We have also received an audit for years 2018 - 2020 covering couriers who used the Postmates platform. The ultimate resolution of the\nmatter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nNew York Department of Labor\nIn February 2020, the New York Department of Labor (\u201cNYDOL\u201d) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for\npurposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2013 through 2020. The NYDOL issued an assessment in November 2022,\nagainst Uber. The ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on\nthe consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022.\nNon-Income Tax Matters\nWe recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with\nregard to such matters.\n123The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arise from the characterization for tax purposes of the transactions on the\nplatform, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and employment taxes related to our Drivers and Couriers. In jurisdictions with disputes\nconnected to transactions on the platform, disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales tax, VAT, GST and similar taxes) or gross receipts\ntaxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to employment taxes, disputes involve the applicability of withholding taxes related to employment taxes or back-up\nwithholding on payments made to Drivers, Couriers, and Merchants.\nOur estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in certain jurisdictions;\ntherefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.\nOn October 31, 2022, we settled our UK VAT dispute with the HMRC, the UK tax regulator, for all periods prior to March 14, 2022. As a result of the\nsettlement agreement, these prior periods are closed to assessment and Uber made a payment of $733 million (GBP 613 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022 for\nthis resolution.\nAs of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation and is required to remit\nVAT. Uber UK is remitting VAT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (\u201cVAT Order 1987\u201d), which allows for VAT remittance on a calculated\nmargin, rather than on Gross Bookings. As part of our ongoing discussions with HMRC, they have indicated that they are reviewing our VAT filings. The HMRC\nmay disagree with our application of VAT Order 1987, but due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes, any reasonably\npossible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\nOther Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe have been and continue to be subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our business practices,\ncompliance with antitrust, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (including Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws,\nsecurities laws, data protection and privacy laws, consumer protection laws, environmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We\nhave investigated and continue to investigate many of these matters and we are implementing a number of recommendations to our managerial, operational and\ncompliance practices, as well as strengthening our overall governance structure. In many cases, we are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of these\ninquiries and investigations on our business which could be time consuming, costly to investigate and require significant management attention. Furthermore, the\noutcome of these inquiries and investigations could negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results, including possible fines\nand penalties and requiring changes to operational activities and procedures.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties. Pursuant to these provisions,\nwe may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with their activities or non-compliance with certain\nrepresentations and warranties made by us. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former\nemployees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss\nunder these indemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.\nNote 15 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities\nVIEs are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support.\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct\nthe activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of these consolidated\nVIEs.\nTotal assets included on the consolidated balance sheets for our consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 were $3.9 billion and $3.9 billion,\nrespectively. Total liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheets for these VIEs as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 were $1.0 billion and $789 million,\nrespectively.\nFreight Holding\nIn July 2018, we created a new majority-owned subsidiary, Uber Freight Holding Corporation (\u201cFreight Holding\u201d). The purpose of Freight Holding is to\nperform the business activities of the Freight operating segment. The Freight Holding stock held by us was determined to be a variable interest.\nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement (\u201c2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d)\nwith outside investor (\u201c2020 Freight Series A Investor\u201d) to sell shares of Series A Preferred Stock (\u201cFreight Series A\u201d).\nIn July 2021, we entered into a Freight Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Series A to The Public Investment Fund, which\nis an investor in Uber.\n124In November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a series A-1 stock purchase agreement (\u201c2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) with outside\ninvestors (\u201cFreight Series A-1 Investors\u201d) to sell shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock of Freight Holding (\u201cFreight Series A-1\u201d). Neither the Freight\nSeries A or Freight Series A-1 investments changed the conclusion that Freight Holding is a consolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we continue to\nown the majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Freight Holding and report non-controlling interest as further described in Note 16 \u2013 Non-\nControlling Interests.\nDivestiture of ATG Business and Aurora Investments\nIn 2019, we contributed certain of our subsidiaries and certain assets and liabilities related to our autonomous vehicle technologies (excluding liabilities arising\nfrom certain indemnification obligations related to the Levandowski arbitration and any remediation costs associated with certain obligations that may arise as a\nresult of the Waymo settlement) to Apparate in exchange for common units representing 100% ownership interest in Apparate. Subsequent to the formation of\nApparate, Apparate entered into a Class A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement (\u201cPreferred Unit Purchase Agreement\u201d) with SVF Yellow (USA) Corporation\n(\u201cSoftBank\u201d), Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (\u201cToyota\u201d), and DENSO International America, Inc. (\u201cDENSO\u201d). Preferred units were issued in 2019 to\nSoftBank, Toyota, and DENSO and provided the investors with an aggregate 13.8% initial ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis. The common\nunits held by us in Apparate were determined to be a variable interest. The purpose of Apparate was to develop and commercialize autonomous vehicle and\nridesharing technologies and Apparate\u2019s results were part of All Other. Refer to Note 13 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Information for further\ninformation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we consolidated the ATG Business\u2019 assets and liabilities and reported non-controlling interests.\nIn January 2021, we completed the sale of the ATG Business to Aurora. Refer to the section titled \u201cUnconsolidated VIEs\u201d below for additional information on\nAurora. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures for further information on the sale of the ATG Business.\nCareem Qatar and Morocco\nOn January 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to an asset purchase\nagreement (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d) in countries where regulatory approval was obtained or which did not require regulatory approval. The assets and\noperations in Qatar and Morocco (collectively \u201cNon-Transferred Countries\u201d) had not yet been transferred to us as of the purchase date. The purpose of the Careem\nQatar and Morocco\u2019s operations is to provide primarily ridesharing services in each respective country. Although the assets and operations of the Non-Transferred\nCountries were not transferred as of the purchase date, we had rights to all residual interests in the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries which was\nconsidered a variable interest. We were exposed to losses and residual returns of the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries through the right to all of\nthe proceeds from either the divestiture or the eventual legal transfer upon regulatory approval of the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries. We\ncontrolled Intellectual Properties (\u201cIP\u201d) which are significant for the business of Non-Transferred Countries and sub-license those IP to the Non-Transferred\nCountries. Each entity that comprised the Non-Transferred Countries met the definition of a VIE and we were the primary beneficiary of each of the entities\ncomprising the Non-Transferred Countries.\nOn September 21, 2021, ownership of Careem\u2019s operations in Morocco was fully transferred to us. As of December 31, 2021, the assets and operations in\nCareem Qatar had not been transferred to us. We are exposed to losses and residual returns of the Careem Qatar entity through the right to all of the proceeds from\neither the divestiture or the eventual legal transfer, upon regulatory approval, of the Careem Qatar entity. We were the primary beneficiary and consolidated Careem\nQatar as of December 31, 2021.\nIn October 2022, Qatar\u2019s Court of Cassation rejected our final appeal for the proposed acquisition of the assets and operations of Careem Qatar. However, we\ncontinue to be the primary beneficiary of Careem Qatar and as a result, we consolidated Careem Qatar as of December 31, 2022.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the entities\u2019 economic performance. Our carrying amount of assets recognized on the consolidated balance sheets related to unconsolidated\nVIEs were $598 million and $548 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and represents our maximum exposure to loss associated with the\nunconsolidated VIEs.\nZomato\n125Zomato is incorporated in India with the purposes of providing food delivery services. On January 21, 2020, we acquired compulsorily convertible cumulative\npreference shares (\u201cCCPS Preferred Shares\u201d) of Zomato valued at $171 million in exchange for Uber\u2019s food delivery operations in India (\u201cUber Eats India\u201d), and a\nnote receivable valued at $35 million for reimbursement of goods and services tax. As of December 31, 2020, our investment in the CCPS Preferred Shares of\nZomato represented 9.99% of the voting capital upon conversion to ordinary shares. Zomato was a VIE as it lacked sufficient equity to finance its activities without\nfuture subordinated financial support. We were exposed to Zomato\u2019s economic risks and rewards through our investment and note receivable which represent\nvariable interests, and the carrying values of these variable interests reflect our maximum exposure to loss. However, we were not the primary beneficiary because\nneither the investment in CCPS Preferred Shares nor the note receivable provide us with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Zomato\u2019s\neconomic performance. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures for further information regarding Zomato and the divestiture of Uber Eats India.\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the outstanding note receivable was paid. During the third quarter of 2021, we determined Zomato is no longer a VIE as it\nis sufficiently capitalized as a result of its IPO in India during July 2021. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of our entire stake in Zomato\nordinary shares. Refer to Note 3 \u2013 Investments and Fair Value Measurement for further information.\nLime\nNeutron Holdings, Inc. (\u201cLime\u201d) is incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning and operating a fleet of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for short-term\naccess use by consumers for personal transportation. On May 7, 2020, we entered into the JUMP Divestiture and received the 2020 Lime Investments. Refer to\nNote 18 \u2013 Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture and the 2020 Lime Investments. We are exposed to Lime\u2019s economic risks and rewards\nthrough our ownership of the 2020 Lime Investments, which represent variable interests.\nCornershop: CS-Mexico\nAs of December 31, 2020, Cornershop Cayman\u2019s (\u201cCornershop\u201d) business operations in Mexico (\u201cCS-Mexico\u201d) were determined to be a variable interest. We\nwere exposed to CS-Mexico\u2019s economic risks and rewards through: the CS-Mexico Put/Call; an immaterial unsecured note; the contractual rights to 35% of\ncontingent sale proceeds from CS-Mexico under certain conditions; and a market-based fee related to the transition services agreement, all of which represented\nvariable interests held by Uber. However, we were not the primary beneficiary and we did not consolidate CS-Mexico.\nIn December 2020, we received approval from Mexico\u2019s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction. On January 11, 2021, Cornershop Global\n(\u201cCS-Global\u201d), an entity which held all of Cornershop business operations, except for those in Mexico, exercised a call option and acquired 100% of the\noutstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico. We owned 55% of CS-Mexico through our ownership in CS-Global. The acquisition of CS-Mexico by CS-Global\ntriggered a reconsideration event and we reevaluated if CS-Mexico still met the definition of a VIE. As of December 31, 2021, we determined that CS-Mexico was\nno longer a VIE when it was acquired by CS-Global, which has sufficient equity to operate without the need for subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 17 \u2013\nBusiness Combinations for further information.\n126Aurora\nIn January 2021, we sold our ATG Business to Aurora. After the sale, we held equity interests in Aurora through our Aurora Investments. As of December 31,\n2021, our Aurora Investments had a fair value of $3.4 billion within investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer Note 3 \u2013 Investments and Fair Value\nMeasurement for additional information regarding the accounting for our Aurora Investments and Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures for additional information regarding the\nsale of our ATG Business.\nAfter the sale in January 2021, we initially determined Aurora was a VIE as it lacked sufficient equity to finance its activities without future subordinated\nfinancial support. We were exposed to Aurora\u2019s economic risks and rewards through our equity interests, which represented variable interests. On November 3,\n2021, Aurora completed its planned SPAC merger with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, making Aurora a publicly traded company post combination, which\ntriggered a reconsideration event. We reevaluated if Aurora still met the definition of a VIE and determined that Aurora was no longer a VIE when it completed its\nSPAC merger given it had sufficient equity to operate without the need for subordinated financial support.\nMoove\nOn February 12, 2021 (the \u201cMoove Closing Date\u201d), we entered into and completed a series of agreements with Garment Investments S.L. dba Moove\n(\u201cMoove\u201d), a vehicle fleet operator in Spain, including (i) an equity investment, through preferred shares, in which Uber acquired a 30% minority interest in\nMoove from its current shareholders at closing and up to approximately $185 million contingent on future performance of Moove and certain other conditions\nthrough the eighth anniversary of the agreement, (ii) a term loan of $213 million to Moove, due February 2026, and (iii) a commercial partnership agreement. Also\nincluded in the agreements is an option for us to purchase common stock of Moove at fair value, beginning two years after the Moove Close Date. After this series\nof agreements, Moove is considered a related party.\nOur equity investment in Moove, through preferred shares, is accounted for as an investment in non-marketable equity securities included in investments on\nthe consolidated balance sheets. The term loan, $215 million as of December 31, 2022, is accounted for as a loan receivable, carried at amortized cost, and included\nin other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 3 \u2013 Investments and Fair Value Measurement, Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring\nBasis, for additional information regarding our non-marketable equity securities.\nMoove is a VIE as it lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities without future subordinated financial support. We are exposed to Moove\u2019s economic risks\nand rewards through our equity investment, the term loan and commercial partnership agreement, which represent variable interests.\n127Note 16 \u2013 Non-Controlling Interests\nWe have several consolidated subsidiaries that have issued common stock and preferred stock or preferred units to third party investors, representing non-\ncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the amounts of non-controlling interests represented by subsidiaries\u2019 preferred units and preferred stock\nwere $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\nATG Investment: Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement\nDuring 2019, we closed a Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement with SoftBank, Toyota, and DENSO (collectively \u201cthe Investors\u201d) for purchase by the Investors\nof Class A Preferred Units (\u201cPreferred Units\u201d) in Apparate. Apparate, a subsidiary of ours, issued 1.0 million Preferred Units at $1,000 per unit to the Investors for\nan aggregate consideration of $1.0 billion ($400 million from Toyota, $333 million from SoftBank, and $267 million from DENSO). As of December 31, 2020, the\nPreferred Units represented an aggregate 14.2% ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis and we retained the remaining 85.8% ownership interest.\nAt the option of the Investors, the Preferred Units were convertible into common units of Apparate, initially on a one-for-one basis but subject to potential\nadjustment, as defined by the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement at any time. The Preferred Units were entitled to certain distributions, including primarily\ndividends which are payable in cash or in-kind (at Apparate's discretion), and accrue quarterly, compounded on the last day of each quarter at a 4.5% annual rate.\nThe Preferred Units were entitled to distributions upon the occurrence of a sale or liquidation of Apparate representing an amount that is equal to the greater of (i)\nthe original investment plus any accrued but unpaid amounts, and (ii) their share of distributions assuming conversion to common units of Apparate immediately\nprior to the sale or liquidation event. The quarterly dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Apparate\u2019s net income (if applicable), were included in net\nincome (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations. The Preferred Units did not participate in net losses\ndue to a liquidation preference.\nSoftBank\u2019s Preferred Units\nSoftBank\u2019s Preferred Units included the option to put to us all, but not less than all, of its initial investment in Preferred Units at a price equal to the number of\nSoftBank\u2019s Preferred Units multiplied by the greater of (i) the original investment plus any accrued but unpaid amounts per unit and (ii) the fair value of the\nPreferred Units at the time of conversion (the \u201cPut/Call Price\u201d). In addition, we also had the option to call all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Units held by\nSoftBank at the Put/Call Price. The put and call were determined to be embedded features within the SoftBank Preferred Units since they were not separately\nexercisable or legally detached from the SoftBank Preferred Units. As of December 31, 2020, the SoftBank Preferred Units were classified as redeemable non-\ncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements and reported at the Put/Call Price which was determined as of the balance sheet date.\nToyota and DENSO\u2019s Preferred Units\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Toyota and DENSO Preferred Units were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these units were not subject\nto any mandatory redemption rights or redemption rights that are outside our control.\nDivestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business to Aurora. As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling\ninterests in the ATG Business were settled and ownership of the ATG Business transferred to Aurora. We derecognized the carrying value of non-controlling\ninterests in the ATG Business of $1.1 billion, which included Toyota and DENSO non-redeemable non-controlling interests of $701 million and Softbank\u2019s\nredeemable non-controlling interests of $356 million. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures for further information.\nFreight Holding\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we owned 78% and 74%, respectively, of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our subsidiary Freight Holding, or\n75% and 73%, respectively, on a fully-diluted basis if all common shares reserved for issuance under our Freight Holding employee incentive plan were issued and\noutstanding.\nIn May 2022, Freight Holding adopted the 2022 Freight Holding Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2022 Freight Holding Plan\u201d). The 2022 Freight Holding Plan\nserves as the successor to the 2018 Holding Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2018 Freight Holding Plan\u201d). Awards previously granted under the 2018 Freight Holding\nPlan remain outstanding and governed by the terms of the 2018 Freight Holding Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2021 under the 2018 Freight Holding Plan a total number of 99.8 million shares of Freight Holding were reserved, of which 85.0 million\nshares were available for grant and issuance.\nAs of December 31, 2022 under the 2022 Freight Holding Plan a total number of 85.1 million shares of Freight Holding were reserved, of which 39.4 million\nshares were available for grant and issuance.\nThe redeemable non-controlling interest of Freight Holding is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that the non-controlling\ninterest will become redeemable.\n128Holders of Common Stock of Freight Holding\nThe minority common stockholders of our subsidiary Freight Holding, including any holders of common equity awards issued under the employee equity\nincentive plans and employees who hold fully vested shares, have put rights to sell certain of their equity interests at fair value to us at specified periods of time that\nterminates upon the earliest of the closing of a liquidation transaction or an IPO of the subsidiary. Should the put rights be exercised, they can be satisfied in either\ncash, Uber stock, or a combination of cash and Uber stock based upon our election. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the minority common stockholders\nownership in Freight Holding is classified as a redeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in our control.\nWe attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding\u2019s net income or loss available to holders of common stock to the redeemable non-controlling interests\ngenerated from common shares of Freight Holding based on the outstanding ownership of the minority shareholders of common shares during the period.\nFreight Series A Preferred Stock\nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with a 2020 Freight Series A Investor. Pursuant to\nthe 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor agreed to invest an aggregate of $500 million in Freight\nHolding, which occurred over two closings, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe 2020 Freight Series A Investor had the option to purchase additional shares in tranches of at least $50 million at a time at the initial purchase price for two\nyears following initial closing up to an additional aggregate $250 million. This right to continue to invest at the initial price over two years is a forward obligation\nclassified was a liability measured at fair value which was initially valued using a two-year discount rate and was immaterial. We maintain majority ownership of\nthe issued and outstanding capital stock of Freight Holding following such additional investment. Upon the passage of two years from initial close, the 2020\nFreight Series A Investor must purchase and Freight Holding must issue any remaining unissued additional shares at the purchase price. The 2020 Freight Series A\nInvestor holds two seats on the Freight Holding board of directors as of December 31, 2022.\nIn October 2020, the initial closing occurred pursuant to the 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and 2020 Freight Series A Investor\ninvested $250 million in exchange for 124.7 million shares of Freight Series A preferred stock, representing approximately 8% ownership interest on a fully diluted\nbasis.\nIn August 2022, the second closing occurred pursuant to the Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and the 2020 Freight Series A Investor\ninvested an additional $250 million in exchange for 124.7 million shares of Freight Series A preferred stock. The 2020 Freight Series A Investor is considered a\nrelated party to Freight Holding.\nWe do not attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding\u2019s loss to the redeemable non-controlling interests in Series A Preferred shares of Freight Holding\nbecause these shares are entitled to a liquidation preference and therefore do not participate in losses that would cause their interest to be below the liquidation\npreference. Upon liquidation, these Freight Series A preferred stock are entitled to the greater of either (i) a 1.5x liquidation preference on their initial investment,\nas well as 6% continuously compounding cumulative dividends that will be paid before any distribution to common shareholders or (ii) the fair value of their\ninvestment (the \u201cFreight Series A Liquidation Preference\u201d). The dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Freight Holding\u2019s net income (if applicable),\nare included in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe 2020 Freight Series A Investor\u2019s Freight Series A preferred stock may be called by us at our option after the passage of five years at the Freight Series A\nLiquidation Preference. Beginning after three years, if a series of events occur including Freight Holding not consummating an IPO, 2020 Freight Series A\nInvestor\u2019s Freight Series A preferred stock could become redeemable at the Freight Series A Liquidation Preference upon the passage of five years. Upon\nredemption, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor\u2019s Freight Series A preferred stock would be settled in either cash or Uber common shares at our option.\nIn July 2021, we entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Holding's Series A Preferred Stock to The Public\nInvestment Fund, which is an investor in Uber, representing 4% ownership interest on a fully diluted basis at the time of the sale. As of December 31, 2021 and\n2022, the Freight Series A preferred stock held by the Public Investment Fund were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these shares of\npreferred stock are not subject to any mandatory redemption rights or redemption rights that are outside our control.\nFreight Series A-1 Preferred Stock\n129In November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a 2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Freight Series A-1 Investors. Pursuant to the\n2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the Freight Series A-1 Investors agreed to invest an aggregate of $550 million in Freight Holding in\nexchange for Freight Series A-1 preferred stock. The purchase and sale of the Freight Series A-1 preferred stock took place concurrently with the closing of the\nTransplace acquisition. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Business Combinations for additional information on the Transplace acquisition.\nFreight Series A-1 Investors have basic rights and preferences which primarily include: one vote per share; conversion rights to common shares; 6%\ncumulative dividend preference and liquidation preference (a 1.0x liquidation preference of original issuance price plus cumulative unpaid dividends). The accruing\ndividends are compounding annually, and are only payable when dividends are declared by Freight Holding\u2019s Board. The dividend, along with any attributed\nprorated share of Freight Holding\u2019s net income (if applicable), are included in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our\nconsolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Freight Series A-1 preferred stock held by the Freight Series A-1 Investors were\nclassified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these shares of preferred stock are not subject to any mandatory redemption rights or redemption rights\nthat are outside our control.\nCornershop\nOn July 6, 2020, we closed the acquisition of a 55% controlling ownership interest in CS-Global. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Business Combinations for further\ninformation. As of December 31, 2020, the non-controlling interest in CS-Global was classified as redeemable non-controlling interest because it is subject to a\nput/call agreement which was not solely in our control to exercise. At each balance sheet date, the redeemable non-controlling interest was measured using a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology and the carrying value was adjusted if the fair value was higher than the carrying value. The initial fair value, as of the\nacquisition date of July 6, 2020, was $290 million. There were no fair value adjustments to CS-Global\u2019s redeemable non-controlling interest during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, Cornershop\u2019s financial results were consolidated in our consolidated financial statements given our majority\nownership interest.\nOn January 11, 2021, CS-Global exercised a call option and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, which increased the redeemable\nnon-controlling interest. In August 2021, we acquired the minority shareholders' interests in CS-Global in an all-stock transaction and CS-Global became a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of ours. We derecognized the carrying value of redeemable non-controlling interests in CS-Global of $1.3 billion. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Business\nCombinations for further information.\nNote 17 \u2013 Business Combinations\nCareem\nOn January 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem. Dubai-based Careem was founded in 2012, and provides\nprimarily ridesharing and to a lesser extent meal delivery, and payments services to millions of users in cities across the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and advances our strategy of having a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of\nthe world in which we operate and effect cost and technology synergies for the rest of Uber\u2019s Mobility business. On September 21, 2021, ownership of Careem\u2019s\noperations in Morocco was fully transferred to us. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, ownership of Careem\u2019s operations in Qatar had not be transferred to us;\nhowever the results of operations and net assets were fully consolidated as variable interest entities. Refer to Note 15 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further\ninformation.\nThe acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for Careem was $3.0 billion, which consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nCash paid on January 2, 2020 $ 1,326 \nNon-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes 1,634 \nTransaction costs paid on January 2, 2020 on behalf of Careem 39 \nContingent cash consideration 1 \nStock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services 3 \nTotal consideration $ 3,003 \nThe fair value of the Careem Notes was determined as a sum of the discounted cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d) method (for the present value of the principal amount of the\nCareem Notes) and the Black-Scholes option pricing model (to value the conversion option). The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value\nmeasurement include discount rates of 5.14% to 5.19% for the principal amount of the Careem Notes and for the conversion option an expected volatility of 42.1%\nto 44.1%, interest rates of 1.53% to 1.57%, and dividend yield of 0%. We issued the Careem Notes in different tranches with $880 million of the principal amount\nof the Careem Notes issued on January 2, 2020 and settled in cash on April 1, 2020. Each tranche of the Careem Notes is due and payable 90 days once issued. The\nholders of the Careem Notes may elect to convert the full outstanding principal balance to Class A common stock at a conversion price of $55 per share of Uber\nTechnologies, Inc. at any time prior to maturity. The discount from the Careem Notes face value to fair value will be accreted through the respective repayment\ndates as interest expense.\n130During the year ended December 31, 2021, certain holders of the Careem Notes elected to convert their notes and as a result of such elections, $539 million of\nthe principal amount of the Careem Notes matured, of which $307 million were settled in cash and $232 million were settled in equity. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, certain holders of the Careem Notes elected to convert their notes, resulting in immaterial amounts settled in cash and equity.\nThe remaining amount of the Careem Notes is recognized as a commitment to issue unsecured convertible notes at fair value in accrued and other current\nliabilities of $152 million as of December 31, 2022. The amount of accretion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 was not material.\nCareem: Acquisition Date Fair Value\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):\nFair Value\nCurrent assets $ 43 \nGoodwill 2,483 \nIntangible assets 540 \nOther long-term assets 77 \nTotal assets acquired 3,143 \nCurrent liabilities (108)\nDeferred tax liability (13)\nOther long-term liabilities (19)\nTotal liabilities assumed (140)\nNet assets acquired $ 3,003 \nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill which is not\ndeductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Careem and anticipated operational synergies. Goodwill was recorded\nin our Mobility segment. The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management\u2019s\nestimates and assumptions at the time of acquisition.\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in\nmillions, except years):\nFair ValueWeighted Average Remaining\nUseful Life - Years\nRider relationships $ 270 15\nCaptains network 40 1\nDeveloped technology 110 4\nTrade names 120 10\nTotal $ 540 \nRider relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with Careem riders. Captains network represents the fair value of the underlying\nnetwork with Careem drivers (called \u201cCaptains\u201d). Developed technology represents the fair value of Careem\u2019s technology. Trade names relate to the \u201cCareem\u201d\ntrade name, trademarks, and domain names. The overall weighted average useful life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is ten years.\nTangible net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as we believe that these amounts approximate their current fair\nvalues. We believe the amounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of, and approximate the amounts a market participant would\npay for, these intangible assets as of January 2, 2020.\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement provides for specific indemnities to us in relation to value added tax obligations and other tax reserves of certain jurisdictions\nwhich reflect potential tax liabilities. We recognized $64 million of indemnification assets on the same basis as the tax reserves at January 2, 2020, which is\nrecorded as other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Settlements of these tax reserves, if any, will be funded by the indemnification asset.\nThe results of the acquired operations were included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, January 2, 2020. For the period from\nJanuary 2, 2020 through December 31, 2020, Careem contributed to a loss before income taxes of $218 million. Revenue for the period from January 2, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2020 were not material.\nCornershop\n131In 2019, as a strategic move of entering into grocery delivery market, we agreed to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d),\noperating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico. During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the \u201cInitial Cornershop\nInvestment\u201d). The remaining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the countries where Cornershop operates.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico. As a result, we and Cornershop amended the terms of the agreement\nin order for Uber to acquire Cornershop\u2019s business operations, except for those in Mexico. Immediately prior to the transaction close, Cornershop was restructured\nsuch that the Mexico operations were held in Cornershop Technologies LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as \u201cCS-Mexico\u201d), while all\nof the remaining Cornershop operations were to be held in the newly created CS-Global entity.\nOn July 6, 2020, we acquired 55% controlling interest in CS-Global, an entity which held all of Cornershop\u2019s business operations, except for those in Mexico.\nThis transaction resulted in an Uber direct capital contribution of $200 million, which included the Initial Cornershop Investment and notes receivable, to CS-\nGlobal and a payment of $179 million to tendering shareholders, paid in a combination of cash and 2,055,038 shares of our common stock. The Initial Cornershop\nInvestment was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber\u2019s pre-acquisition ownership\npercentage, the new value was not materially different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at the\noriginal $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% of\nthe outstanding membership interests. As a result, we obtained the controlling financial interest in CS-Global and accounted for the acquisition as a business\ncombination. Concurrent with the CS-Global acquisition transaction, Uber, Cornershop and CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controlling\ninterest in CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right through the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of the\ninterests in CS-Mexico, contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (\u201cCS-Mexico Put/Call\u201d). Upon either the exercise of the call option (by CS-\nGlobal) or the put option (by Cornershop), CS-Global would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in CS-Mexico. Uber would make a direct capital\ncontribution to CS-Global and a payment to the tendering shareholder, totaling $94 million, in exchange for 55% outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico. The\nCS-Mexico Put/Call, which was exercisable in 5 years if there is no IPO or liquidation event, at a future negotiated price, was accounted for separately from the\nacquisition, and was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nThe acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for CS-Global was $362 million, which consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nInitial Cornershop Investment $ 50 \nNotes receivable 10 \nCash paid 253 \nTender offer paid in Uber common stock 67 \nTotal consideration transferred 380 \nLess: CS-Mexico Put/Call (18)\nTotal consideration $ 362 \nThe following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):\nFair Value\nCurrent assets $ 204 \nGoodwill 384 \nIntangible assets 122 \nOther long-term assets 11 \nTotal assets acquired 721 \nCurrent liabilities (34)\nDeferred tax liability (33)\nOther long-term liabilities (2)\nTotal liabilities assumed (69)\nLess: Redeemable non-controlling interests (290)\nNet assets acquired $ 362 \nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill which is not\ndeductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the anticipated operational synergies. Goodwill\n132was recorded in our Delivery segment. The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on\nmanagement's estimates and assumptions at the time of acquisition, and are updated to reflect the most recent changes.\nThe fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests of $290 million was estimated based on the non-controlling interest\u2019s respective share of the CS-\nGlobal enterprise value.\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in\nmillions, except years):\nFair ValueWeighted Average Remaining\nUseful Life - Years\nVendor relationship $ 20 15\nShopper relationship 1 1\nCustomer relationship 14 5\nDeveloped technology 58 4\nTrade names 29 5\nTotal $ 122 \nVendor, shopper and customer relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with Cornershop vendors (such as grocery stores and\nsupermarkets), shoppers and end-users. Developed technology represents the fair value of the technologies and systems behind CS-Global\u2019s grocery delivery\napplication. Trade names relate to the \u201cCornershop\u201d trade name, trademarks, and domain names. The overall weighted average useful life of the identified\namortizable intangible assets acquired is six years.\nTangible net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as we believe that these amounts approximate their current fair\nvalues. We believe the amounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of, and approximate the amounts a market participant would\npay for, these intangible assets as of July 6, 2020.\nThe results of CS-Global were included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, July 6, 2020. For the period from July 6, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2020, CS-Global contributed an immaterial amount of revenue and loss before taxes.\nIn December 2020, we received approval from Mexico\u2019s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction. On January 11, 2021, CS-Global exercised\nthe call option through the CS-Mexico Put/Call agreement and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, and we owned 55% of CS-Mexico\nthrough our ownership in CS-Global. The acquisition of CS-Mexico was accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the\nconsideration transferred for CS-Mexico was immaterial, and consisted of a combination of cash payment and equity payment in Uber common stock and the fair\nvalue of the CS-Mexico Put/Call remeasured at the acquisition date. As a result of remeasuring our prior CS-Mexico Put/Call held immediately prior to the\nbusiness combination, we recognized an immaterial loss during the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss was included in other income (expense), net in the\nconsolidated statement of operations.\nIn August 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest (or 47%, on a fully-diluted basis) in Cornershop in an all-stock\ntransaction. As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock, including 4.6 million\nrestricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees. In addition, we issued 4 million stock options to replace assumed outstanding stock options. These\nreplacement stock options attributable to post-acquisition service were included in our option activity and were recognized as stock-based compensation expense.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain\nor loss in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with this acquisition, the previously recognized non-\ncontrolling interest was derecognized. Following this transaction, Cornershop became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nThe total purchase price was determined to be $967 million, based on the number of shares issued and Uber\u2019s share price on the closing date. The fair value of\nthe 4.6 million restricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees was determined to be $202 million. These shares are restricted and contingent on the\nemployees\u2019 continuing employment at the combined company for three years, beginning in August 2021. These restricted shares are considered compensation for\npost-combination services and will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense ratably over three years.\nPostmates\nOn July 5, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire 100% ownership interest in Postmates, an on-demand delivery platform in the\nU.S.\nOn December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates, bringing together our global Mobility and Delivery platform with Postmates\u2019 distinctive\ndelivery business in the U.S. As a result of the transaction, we obtained ownership interest in Postmates\n133through our voting rights, and the transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for\nPostmates was approximately $3.9 billion, which consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nUber common stock transferred $ 3,494 \nNote receivable 100 \nStock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services 308 \nTotal consideration $ 3,902 \nThe fair value of the $3.5 billion common stock issued (70 million shares of our common stock), as consideration transferred was determined on the basis of\nthe closing market price of our common stock on the acquisition date. We determined the fair value of the equity awards for stock options assumed using a Black-\nScholes option pricing model with the applicable assumptions as of the acquisition date. The fair value of equity awards for RSUs was determined by using the\nclosing market price of our common stock on the acquisition date adjusted by an exchange ratio.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):\nFair Value\nCash and cash equivalents $ 52 \nOther current assets 58 \nGoodwill 3,330 \nIntangible assets 1,015 \nOther long-term assets 57 \nTotal assets acquired 4,512 \nAccounts payable (109)\nAccrued and other current liabilities (458)\nDeferred tax liability (9)\nOther long-term liabilities (34)\nTotal liabilities assumed (610)\nNet assets acquired $ 3,902 \nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is not\ndeductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Postmates and anticipated operational synergies. Goodwill was assigned\nto our Delivery segment. The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management\u2019s\nestimates and assumptions at the time of acquisition.\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in\nmillions, except years):\nFair ValueWeighted Average Remaining\nUseful Life - Years\nMerchant relationship $ 260 7\nFleet relationship 110 1.5\nConsumer relationship 280 5\nDeveloped technology 280 2\nTrade names 30 3\nIPR&D 55 N/A\nTotal $ 1,015 \nConsumer, merchant and fleet relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with merchants (such as restaurants), Postmates end-users,\nand Postmates couriers (referred to as \u201cfleet\u201d).

The overall weighted average useful life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is four years.\nTangible net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as these amounts approximate their fair values.\n134The results of Postmates were included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, December 1, 2020. For the period from\nDecember 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, Postmates contributed an immaterial amount of revenue and loss before taxes.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we finalized our estimate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed for Postmates.\nAs a result, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded measurement period adjustments of $181 million net, to accrued and other current liabilities\nand deferred tax liability, with a corresponding increase to goodwill.\nDrizly\nOn February 2, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization to acquire 100% ownership interest in Drizly, an on-demand alcohol\nmarketplace in North America.\nOn October 12, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Drizly, allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business. The acquisition of Drizly was\naccounted for as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for Drizly was approximately $943 million, which\nconsisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nCommon stock issued $ 881 \nCash 42 \nStock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services 20 \nTotal consideration $ 943 \nThe fair value of the $881 million common stock issued (19 million shares of our common stock), as consideration transferred was determined on the basis of\nthe closing market price of our common stock on the acquisition date.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):\nFair Value\nCurrent assets $ 50 \nGoodwill 619 \nIntangible assets 395 \nOther long-term assets 7 \nTotal assets acquired 1,071 \nCurrent liabilities (44)\nDeferred tax liability (79)\nNon-current liabilities (5)\nTotal liabilities assumed (128)\nNet assets acquired $ 943 \nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is not\ndeductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Drizly and anticipated operational synergies. Goodwill was assigned to\nour Delivery segment. The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management\u2019s estimates\nand assumptions at the time of acquisition. Tangible net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as these amounts\napproximate their fair values.\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in\nmillions, except years):\nFair ValueWeighted Average Remaining\nUseful Life - Years\nConsumer relationship $ 60 5\nRetailer relationship 90 10\nAdvertiser relationship 140 12\nDeveloped technology 75 3\nTrade names 30 6\nTotal $ 395 \n135Consumer, retailer, and advertiser relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with Drizly end-users, retailers (such as liquor stores),\nand advertisers.

The overall weighted average useful life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is eight years.\nThe results of Drizly were included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, October 12, 2021. For the period from October 12,\n2021 through December 31, 2021, Drizly contributed an immaterial amount of revenue and loss before taxes.\nTransplace\nOn July 21, 2021, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire 100% ownership interest in Transplace, a leading transportation management and\nthird-party logistics provider in North America.\nOn November 12, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Transplace in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight business through\nTransplace\u2019s expertise in transportation management. The acquisition of Transplace was accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of\nthe consideration transferred for Transplace was $2.3 billion.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):\nFair Value\nCash and cash equivalents $ 29 \nAccounts receivable, net 899 \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 23 \nProperty and equipment, net 44 \nOperating lease right-of-use assets 57 \nIntangible assets, net 902 \nGoodwill 1,438 \nOther assets 3 \nTotal assets acquired 3,395 \nAccounts payable (516)\nOperating lease liabilities, current (7)\nAccrued and other current liabilities (363)\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current (66)\nDeferred tax liability (163)\nOther long-term liabilities (1)\nTotal liabilities assumed (1,116)\nNet assets acquired $ 2,279 \nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is\nprimarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Transplace and anticipated operational synergies. Goodwill was assigned to our Freight segment. The fair values\nassigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management\u2019s estimates and assumptions at the time of\nacquisition.\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in\nmillions, except years):\nFair ValueWeighted Average Remaining\nUseful Life - Years\nConsumer relationships $ 530 12\nDeveloped technology 363 7\nTrade names 9 2\nTotal $ 902 \nCustomer relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with Transplace customers who utilize their logistics services.

The overall weighted average useful life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is ten years.\n136The results of Transplace were included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, November 12, 2021. For the period from\nNovember 12, 2021 through December 31, 2021, Transplace contributed $684 million of revenue and an immaterial amount of loss before taxes.\nCertain Unaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents what our results would have been had we acquired Careem, CS-Global, Postmates and\nTransplace in the beginning of the applicable comparable prior annual reporting period. The 2020 pro forma includes full year results for: our 2020 acquisitions\n(Careem, CS-Global and Postmates) as well as Transplace. The 2021 pro forma includes full year results for Transplace. The unaudited pro forma information\npresented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations of the consolidated business had the\nacquisitions actually occurred at the beginning of applicable comparable prior reporting period or of the results of our future operations of the consolidated\nbusiness.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions) 2020 2021\n(Unaudited)\nRevenue $ 15,158 $ 21,764 \nNet loss including non-controlling interests (7,342) (700)\nThe pro forma financial information primarily includes adjustments to net loss including non-controlling interests to reflect the additional amortization that\nwould have been recorded assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible assets had been applied from the beginning of applicable comparable prior reporting\nperiod, with the related tax effects.\nNote 18 \u2013 Divestitures\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we completed the following divestitures:\n\u2022In 2020, divestitures consisted of the sale of our Uber Eats India operations, the disposition of all assets of our JUMP business, and the sale of our\nEuropean Freight business to Sennder.\n\u2022In 2021, divestitures consisted of the sale of our ATG Business, a subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle\ntechnology, to Aurora.\nThe gains (losses) associated with these divestitures were included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDivestiture of Uber Eats India to Zomato\nOn January 21, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement and completed the divestiture of Uber Eats India to Zomato in exchange for (i) CCPS Preferred\nShares of Zomato convertible into ordinary shares representing, when converted, 9.99% of the total voting capital of Zomato and (ii) a non-interest bearing note\nreceivable to be repaid over the course of four years for reimbursement by Zomato of goods and services tax. The estimated fair value of the consideration received\nincluded the investment valued at $171 million and the $35 million of reimbursement of goods and services tax receivable from Zomato. As of December 31, 2021,\nwe had collected substantially all of the receivable. The fair value of the CCPS Preferred Shares was based primarily on the observed transaction price for a similar\nsecurity issued to new investors in close proximity to the time of our transaction with Zomato. The transaction resulted in a gain on disposal of $154 million\nrecognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2020. The income tax effect of the sale was not\nmaterial. The divestiture of Uber Eats India did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and\ntherefore does not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes.\nDivestiture of JUMP and Investment in Lime\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a series of transactions and agreements with Lime to divest our JUMP business (the \u201cJUMP Divestiture\u201d). Lime is\nincorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning and operating a fleet of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for short-term access use by consumers for personal\ntransportation. We previously held Lime Series C preferred stock and fully vested warrants to purchase Lime Series C-1 preferred stock.\nUber contributed hardware, equipment, intellectual property rights, technology, licensed technology, and permits of our JUMP business (collectively, \u201cJUMP\nAssets\u201d) in certain markets to Lime. JUMP Assets and previously held investments and warrants in Lime were exchanged for common stock (the \u201cLime Common\nStock\u201d), newly issued Lime Series 1-C preferred stock (\u201cLime 1-C Preferred Stock\u201d) and fully vested warrants to purchase Lime Series 1-C Preferred Stock (\u201cLime\n1-C Preferred Stock Warrants\u201d). Lime Common Stock represents approximately 10% of fully-diluted (22% undiluted) ownership interest in Lime as of December\n31, 2022.\n137Concurrently, we contributed $85 million of cash to Lime in exchange for a secured note convertible into Lime Series 3 Preferred Stock (the \u201cLime\nConvertible Note\u201d), which may be converted at any time at our election representing 20% initial ownership in Lime as converted on a fully-diluted basis. In\naddition, we entered into a call option agreement which gives us for a two-year period beginning May 7, 2022 the right to acquire all of the outstanding equity\ninterests of Lime held by its shareholders at fair value on the date of exercise, subject to regulatory approval. We have one seat on Lime\u2019s five-person board of\ndirectors. We also amended our preexisting commercial agreement with Lime.\nOur ownership in Lime is comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note\n(collectively, the \u201c2020 Lime Investments\u201d) and represents approximately 30% on an as converted and fully-diluted basis as of December 31, 2022. The 2020 Lime\nInvestments are accounted for under the fair value option. Refer to Note 3 - Investments and Fair Value Measurement for additional information. Lime was\nassessed under the VIE model and considered an unconsolidated VIE. Refer to Note 15 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for additional information.\nThe JUMP Divestiture did not represent a strategic shift that would cause a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify\nfor reporting as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. The resulting loss on disposal was not material to us and was recorded in other income\n(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations during the second quarter of 2020.\nDivestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business, a subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of\nautonomous vehicle technology, to Aurora. As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownership of\nthe ATG Business transferred to Aurora.\nAs consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A Stated\nLiquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interests on our consolidated\nbalance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in the form of\nAurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested $400\nmillion in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora.\nRefer to Note 3 \u2013 Investments and Fair Value Measurement for additional information.\nWe do not consolidate Aurora under either the VIE or the voting interest model. For further information, refer to Note 15 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities.\nWe entered into a commercial agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with best efforts to launch and commercialize self-driving\nvehicles on our ridesharing network. We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continue\nto vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora. As a result, we recognized liabilities of $315 million as consideration for these\nfuture obligations to Aurora.\nThe sale of the ATG Business did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does\nnot qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation. The resulting gain on disposal was recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nThe following table presents the gain on sale of the ATG Business (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021\nFair value of common shares received $ 1,277 \nDerecognition of ATG Business' non-controlling interests 1,057 \nLiability recognized for future obligations (315)\nNet consideration received for sale of the ATG Business 2,019 \nCarrying value of net assets transferred (375)\nGain on the sale of the ATG Business $ 1,644 \nNote 19 \u2013 Restructuring and Related Charges\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we initiated and completed certain restructuring activities in order to reduce our overall cost structure in response to the\neconomic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business. We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costs\nrelated to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs.\nThe following table presents the total restructuring and related charges associated with our segments as well as corporate charges (in millions):\n138Year Ended December 31,\n2020\nMobility $ 67 \nDelivery 32 \nFreight 7 \nAll Other 175 \nTotal restructuring and related charges by segment 281 \nCorporate G&A and Platform R&D 81 \nTotal restructuring and related charges $ 362 \n Includes restructuring and related charges associated with the exit of the JUMP business, including severance and other termination benefits of $30 million,\nsite closure costs of $21 million and other costs of $65 million.\nThe following table presents the total restructuring and related charges, by function (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\nOperations and support $ 172 \nSales and marketing 21 \nResearch and development 85 \nGeneral and administrative 84 \nTotal $ 362 \nThe following table provides the components of and changes in our restructuring and related charges accrual during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021\nand 2022 (in millions):\nSeverance and Other\nTermination Benefits Site Closure Costs Other Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2019 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 \nCharges 199 98 65 362 \nCash payments (197) (3) (45) (245)\nNon-cash adjustments \u2014 (95) (19) (114)\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 2 \u2014 1 3 \nCash payments (2) \u2014 \u2014 (2)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 \u2014 \u2014 1 1 \nNon-cash adjustments \u2014 \u2014 (1) (1)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 \n Site closure costs primarily includes $50 million related to the impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and $38 million for write-offs of leasehold\nimprovements.\nTotal restructuring and related charges included $247 million of cash settled charges, primarily for severance and other termination benefits and were\nsubstantially paid as of December 31, 2020.(1)\n(1)\n (1), (2)\n(1)\n(2) \n139Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\nThe table below details the activity of the allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, and insurance reserves (in millions):\nBalance at\nBeginning of\nPeriod Additions Deductions Balance at\nEnd of\nPeriod\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\nAllowance for doubtful accounts $ 34 $ 178 $ (157)$ 55 \nDeferred tax asset valuation allowance $ 9,855 $ 3,655 $ (100)$ 13,410 \nInsurance reserves $ 3,418 $ 950 $ (902)$ 3,466 \nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nAllowance for doubtful accounts $ 55 $ 246 $ (250)$ 51 \nDeferred tax assets valuation allowance $ 13,410 $ 571 $ (61)$ 13,920 \nInsurance reserves $ 3,466 $ 1,696 $ (1,174)$ 3,988 \nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nAllowance for doubtful accounts $ 51 $ 286 $ (257)$ 80 \nDeferred tax assets valuation allowance $ 13,920 $ 2,204 $ (2,153)$ 13,971 \nInsurance reserves $ 3,988 $ 2,128 $ (1,396)$ 4,720 \nAdditions to insurance reserves include $35 million, $69 million and $152 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively, for\nchanges in estimates resulting from new developments in prior period claims. Additions to insurance reserves also include $374 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 for reserves assumed in connection with a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement. For additional information on the loss portfolio\ntransfer reinsurance agreement, see Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to an increase in tax rate in the Netherlands, an\nincrease in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase\nin U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year, offset partially by the\nrelease of the valuation allowance due to deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the acquisitions providing an additional source of taxable income to support\nthe realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred tax assets resulting from\nthe loss from operations, offset by the deferred tax impact from the transfer of certain intangible assets among our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we\nfile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule\n13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures\nare effective at a reasonable assurance level.(1), (2) (2)\n(1) \n(2) \n140Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our\nmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its\nobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in\n\u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on that\nassessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. In addition,\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2022.
